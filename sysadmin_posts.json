It looks like everything is good to go, but I am waiting for onboarding to finish.\n\nUser accounts here are created in the following format:\n\nFirstname [Lastname@localdomain.domainname.com](mailto:Lastname@localdomain.domainname.com)\n\nSo, when a user logs in for the first time they do so with: LOCALDOMAIN\\\\Firstname Lastname\n\nThat space is causing problems migrating accounts. I need to edit the UPN attribute of all users before they can sync. I have tested on two, but now I have a question.\n\nHow important is UPN in the domain? Can I make it whatever unique thing I want? I would really like to see it match the users email address that they will login to M365 with. Can I just do that without breaking anything? I don't see anything broken on the two test accounts I tried it on, but I want to be sure."

I can use different server for the files for better responses time(closer to user)\n\nThe \"problem\" with this approach is how to attach the files to the post( If it was same server i would just save the file name in the database) but now, a different server save the file with some random name that the data server wont know.\n\nSo i thought maybe to put Id on the client and with that id I'll save the post id and the file name.

Recently I found after windows update and reboot, the vdhx for my DC is toast, 0kb!\n\nWhat would be the best way to get the network back up, I have a vdhx from 2020, so I figure it’s either try this, or rebuild the whole domain. My main concern is the emails and exchange. \n\nIf I try with the old HDD image, my plan is\n- shutdown, backup the exchange vdhx\n- boot up the old dc vhdx, update, sync and let it settle down\n- boot up exchange\n- if everything’s ok, backup the whole lot and then start working on a more robust backup plan.\n\nAny feedback on this approach would be appreciated… also , any steps I should do to see how the vdhx got corrupted in the first place, will check event log, and scan host HDD with GSmartControl.\n\nN.b not a professional system admin, just running this on my home setup. And yes I’m aware of the issues of only having one DC, and not a great backup solution. Will be addressed as soon as the systems back online"

We own 20 User CALs for this server, and there are 20 Active Directory users.\n* We recently added a **Windows Server 2019**, which will be used solely to install **Microsoft Entra Connect** for syncing our AD accounts to Microsoft 365. We currently own 3 User CALs for this server.\n\n# Question:\n\nGiven that the Windows Server 2019 is only being used for Microsoft Entra Connect and not for any additional user-accessible services, do we need to purchase more User CALs for this server?\n\nAdditional Context:\n\n* The AD role remains on the Windows Server 2012 R2.\n* Only administrators will have direct access to the Windows Server 2019 for managing Entra Connect.\n\nThank You"

            "Original": "Hello, so the problem is that over 2m files of various types, totalling about 1.6TB, need to be copied from the current on-prem Windows server to a new Windows server instance on Azure. Well technically the files are on a network share that's also on-prem, and the server just mounts it. This needs to happen without taking anything offline; the on-prem server needs to be able to keep doing its job the whole time. And while the transfer is happening, which will presumably take at least a few days, new files will be coming into the old source as well.\n\nBoth servers are behind strictly restricted networks, and are only accessible through VPNs. They can reach each other right now, but only on a select number of ports. I don't have control over the network config, but I am in contact with the people who do.\n\nMy current intention is to speak to the relevant sysadmins and arrange it so that the network share can temporarily be mounted by the destination server. Just for however long it takes to copy the files over.\n\nOr I could have the relevant ports opened and run robocopy on the old server to sync the entire directory over.\n\nOOORRR maybe there's another way I'm not aware of yet. Is there?"

What challenges do you face?\n\n3) Do you prefer to use remote tooling (like MMC, WAC or Powershell) or do you just RDP on the box?\n\n4) Do you use RDP connection management tooling or just a bunch of shortcuts on your desktop?\n\n5) From a systems admin perspective, if you could improve something about working with cloud for admin purposes what would it be?"

The portal has an option to white label it and use Custom SMTP so it shows my business email and name instead. My issue is their Custom SMTP option doesn't work directly with Google Workplace emails. Can you help me get my head around how easy it is to just use a third party SMTP relay service like SendGrid instead but keep using my google account. So my client portal would link through the smtp provider to gmail. Is SendGrid really easy to setup with Gmail like this? They dont have much info on their website about how to do it."

More details below.\n  \n    We've tried to include as much details as possible into our ratings, but it's still in beta, so feedback is very welcome!\n  Fundamentals of how the power rating is calculated\n    Each player has their rating split between Attack and Defense, both starting at 1. The ratings are cumulative per side, meaning if a player has a 1.1 rating on the second round of attack, that 1.1 will carry into the third round of attack, and so forth, including overtime. At the end of the game, their overall rating is the weighted average between their rating on each side, and their rounds played on each side.\n  \nHow rating changes during a round\n\n    Each round has a few “events”:\n  \n\n\n    Kill (which also contains death and assist information)\n  \n\n\n    Spike planted\n  \n\n\n    Spike defused\n  \n\n\n    End of round event (survival, and revival bonuses)\n  \n\n\n    The most fundamental event in Valorant is a kill. When a kill occurs, it has a base value. That base value is then manipulated based on a few factors:\n  \n\n\n    Eco advantage / disadvantage for the killer / victim\n  \n\n\n    XvY Situation factor\n  \n\n\n    Was the kill a trade / traded\n  \n\n\n    Was it a first kill\n  \n\n\n    What was the killer’s rating / victims rating at time of death\n  \n\n\n    What was the ratio of damage the killer did to the victim\n  \n\n\n    Did the kill take place after the round has ended\n  \n\n\n    Assist points are also processed at this time\n  \n\n\n    Was it a non damaging utility (smoke, flash, etc)\n  \n\n\n    If not, what ratio of damage did the assister do to the victim?\n  \n\n\n    Players are also awarded an end-of-round bonus\n  \n\n\n    Players that survive get a bonus (also a bigger bonus if they survived after defusing / the bomb was detonated / if they started low eco while the enemy team bought full loadouts)\n  \n\n\n    Sage specifically gets a revival bonus if they revived a player\n  \n\n\n    Before calculating the final value weight adjusted value for each player, we also take into account the sidedness of the map as well.\n  \n    If across our recent professional data a map is 47% attacker and 53% defender sided, meaning it’s easier to win on defense than attack, we factor that in to each team’s ratings on that side. The easier side is slightly adjusted down, and the harder side is slightly adjusted up in a weighted manner.\n  \nWe’d also love to add more data in related to utility usage etc, but at this time it’s not possible with what Riot’s API provides us.\nThe playground (transparency)\n    We don't want our ratings to be a black box - instead we want to open source how it's done and crowdsource help from the community to tweak the parameters while the ratings are still in beta.\n  \n    We developed a playground that takes in a rib match id and gives you a complete round by round, event by event breakdown of exactly what affects a players rating. You can control all of the coefficients, and test out what looks right.\n  \nHere is a link to one of our favorite teams (MXM)’s recent match against The Guard.\n  \n    You can also get here by clicking the link on any rib.gg match above the scoreboard.\n  Examples across multiple series\n    Here are some examples of the ratings averaged across multiple series + events for each VCT region’s regular season + playoffs, only considering players going to Tokyo from this Reddit post.\n  \nVCT Americas\n\nVCT EMEA\n\nVCT Pacific\nFeedback\n    If you have any suggestions feel free to leave them in the comments below / join our discord and talk to us there! This is our v1 beta version, so there’s definitely more changes to come!\n  \n    We are all ears to any feedback in general about the site as well <3\n  Coming up\n    We’re also working a new closed team rating system that will split VCT/VCL/GC/T3 into their own categories on the site, as well as improving our event page and adding some more QOL stuff to the site. We're also partnering with twire.gg to provide stats for their Fantasy Valorant league for Tokyo.\n  \n    If you have any requests or ideas, let us know in the discord!\n  Special thanks\n    We worked with some really awesome community members putting this together, so I’d like to give them a huge shout.\n  \n\n\nFlyn\n\n\n\nCaptaincow285\n\n\n\nBreezly\n\n\n\nWillminder\n\n\n\n    Without help from the community none of what we've done would be possible, so thank you all again, and feel free to get in touch via discord if you have any awesome ideas :D\n  \n\n\n\n      Read more\n

            "Original": "Well, it all started in this episode when I was hard-pushing from my main I'd from bronze to gold. \n\nI reached gold within a week and was very happy with my current stats. The main twist started from this week when I was queueing for comp match, my teammates were so RIOT gifted. I got players from BOODY IRON (AHA OHO), BRONZE and no silvers whereas my enemy team got golds and plats for their queue. \n\nSo I decided after loosing 10 match in a row I should throw matches even if I have a good team. I turned off voice and team chats for every match. I became a professional throwers picking raze, yoru and pheonix for every match for making my team flashed and loose their every map.\n\nI know that the thing that I am doing is not at all funny or to be proud off. But believe me, I was way too done for this game from the beginning."

However, on console valorant it seems like theres a lot of mixed opinions on what sense and curve to use. I tested out all curves in the range by either shooting bots or picking 3 objects on the map and tryna flick around between them—and found standard to be the best with a lower sense like 6 or 7, while heavy/extreme to be better with a higher sense like 10 or 12. However, even after spending all this time in the range im still not convinced on what to use. Im new to valorant and want to know whats the best sense and especially what curve to use so I can just stick to one. What do you guys think?"

Taking space ?  Defend a strategic zone idk for orbs, heals and weapons ?\nPlaying aggressive or defensive ?"

I stumbled upon some videos about aimlab and general aim training procedures. \n\nDo you think its worth it? \nAre you using it? \nIf so: what routines or \"playlist\" would you recommend?\n\nI've seen many people say that DM is really worth it cause you're putting yourself into many 1v1 or 1v2 situations where u can train your aim via \"ingame mechanics\". Makes 100% sense to me. Same for the practice range (it's the one im using). Maybe a combination of them all is the best way? \nIm an old man (30, practically a dinosaur) but I think my reflexes are still good and I wanna improve!\n\nThanks guys!"

That's fine, I expected it, so I practice my sim, which is by far my worst skill. No matter how much I practice it though, I can never get myself to apply anything. How do I get around that roadblock?"

A specific venue has not been announced yet.\nRiot Games cited “significant event production delays and tournament quality concerns,” for the change.

The five-map match lasted over seven and a half hours.\nThe previous format for the ten-team tournament would have seen two different modified double-elimination groups, with the top-three finishers of each group advancing to a six-team, single-elimination knockout stage, where the top teams would earn a bye into the semifinals.\nRiot announced that the new format will be “a more straight-forward, competitive experience.”\nThe tournament will be a ten-team double-elimination bracket, played across eight tournament days. \n“This is a simpler format that will allow for lower bracket opportunities until the grand finals,” Riot said in their statement. “Matches will be played in a best-of-three format before switching to a best-of-five for lower and grand finals.”\nThe event was also originally slated to kick off Sept. 13, but will now be held from Sept. 20-29. Riot has not yet announced information on how the teams will be seeded.\nThe teams participating at Ascension Pacific are:\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRevenant Esports\t\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenant

I mena, RAGE can make double elims in VCJ , so why can't they do that in Ascension, that alone already tells that this is purely riot's decision and RAGE have no power to change that. \nRAGE has more than enough venues and facilities to meet the demands bro, the venue handles the most  if not one of the most visitors in APAC. And I'd say the same about equipment to. Server has to be a riot's fault because server is one of riot's asset , for a company that's so secretive to the point of not wanting to organize a masters with a 3rd party TO, you would expect they're also being secretive about their servers right? ( I'm talking about the 1 hour technical pause).\nThis is not the first time RAGE has organized an offline event and clearly the incident in Grand finals is abnormal. I mean they got 1 month to fix this issue ( I believe it's already fixed , this is riot we're talking about) and riot chose to change location? Yeah I don't think the issue here is about RAGE\nHot take, I think this decision actually hurts RAGE more than Riot, because RAGE reputation has been stained by riot's false promises \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tposted\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 7 hours ago\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t⋅\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tedited 7 hours ago\n\n\n\n\nreply\n•\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#17\n\n\n\t\t\t\thydrazohne\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFrags\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t+\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t–\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nYes, it wouldn't be surprising if RAGE was blacklisted by Japanese venue managers and local governments.\nThey've built up a lot of trust for the Japanese Valorant scene for years, and now it's all gone.\nThe only thing that Valorant in Japan had going for it was its popularity with fans, but it looks like that will be lost too... \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tposted\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 7 hours ago\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nreply\n•\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#19\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIonlywatchvcjXD\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t0 \n\t\t\t\t\t\nFrags\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t+\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t–\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nIt sounds to me like RAGE is the primary scapegoat here 😔.

            "Original": "How come nobody has ever spoken with devs or literally why has there been no changes to Radiante since launch other than adding it to the battle pass? I have so many skins I can't/won't use bc they are not leveled up. I did the math and need 815 Radiante to level up all the skins I have that I want to use (not including all skins that aren't leveled). I refuse to pay for it since you get literally 80 for $50 which you can't even level up a single skin fully for that... Before someone says oh you get it in the battle pass or that I spend to much money on skins I literally can afford it so idc how much money I spend on skins I just hate that i have to pay for skins literally twice, and the battle pass only gives you like 120 which can't even fully upgrade a new released bundle. Does anyone even buy Radianite? I'm genuinely curious. Why haven't the devs made the guns an upgrade system or something to grind skins. The community would literally love that.  Hell everyone would be happy if you maybe gave out 50+ when buying a new $100 skin bundle.... I personally don't know 1 person who buys it so I really want to know are ppl buying this so is that why Riot hasn't changed it or mentioned it at all? Oh and the event going on right now is bs only get 20 Radianite lmao what a JOKE..."

So the entire purpose of playing ranked is pointless because I'm playing people 5x better then me, and I don't want to keep playing since i'm just griefing my team in ranked ;-;\n\nbut unrated is just as bad because either I'm either playing a 4v5 or even a 3v5 and having no fun, or somebody on the other team is better then the rest of the people in the lobby combined and also having no fun ;-;\n\nNobody talks in public chat anymore since every match is just people in parties, I can tell because I always get DMs berating me and worse, so It's not like i can make any friends either\n\nSo I can't really have any fun in any game mode the game offers, sorry for venting but I needed to get it off my chest ;-;"

It was a spectacular lead up to TFS after everything in Wish was said and done, but the notion that it was satisfying in and of itself, versus the reality that TFS was just months away, is delusional.\n\nI would argue a substantial number of Destiny players put up with less elaborate/lower quality content, such as the seasonal model as a whole, largely because there was a sense of predictability that more substantial content was on the horizon. If that suddenly disappears you've robbed people of hope, and when the hope is gone who's sticking around and continuing to pay money — especially in a time where everything is expensive and money is tight — for the gamble that things might turn out ok?\n\nThis feels like another Gambit self fulfilling prophecy. Sales were down on TFS — despite being a phenomenal experience — because people were burned from Lightfall, less resources will be invested into creating larger and more substantial Destiny content, more people will become disengaged, sales will continue to decline, even less funding for resources and development time are put in, repeat until, hell, the announcement that Destiny will no longer be developed?"

IF you could change one thing about each subclass, what would you do and why? \nHere's my personal takes:\nWarlocks should have had Chaos Reach instead of Stormtrance. Feel like it's just the stronger arc super and with transcendence, we don't really need another roaming super.\nTitans should've had Sol Invictus over Consecration. They need more survivability and sunspots are kinda part of their identity.\nHunters are pretty good as they are, I feel Shatterdive over Winters Shroud would've been a better option for a bit more synergy with Duskfields."

How was it possible that someone could join us in this 2-man mission? But it happened. The past two weeks we were taking turns pairing up and getting Ascent and Descent done. Tonight, Friday and I paired up to finish Iconoclasm and one of us would run it again with Gaff later.\n\nI told them both, glitch or not, reward or not, we're finishing this just to see what would happen. We had a great time, and we all got our completion :) and Microcosm. First time, we experienced a weird Destiny glitch like this together.\n\nJust had to share 'cause that was a lot of fun :)"

            "Original": "Don't get me wrong, Still Hunt is still one of, if not the best DPS option available for hunters right now, but the nerf is quite noticeable.  For those who don't know, Still Hunt's damage interaction with Celestial Nighhawk was reduced by 33% along with the removal of Cayde's Retribution shots benefitting from the Sniper's Meditation perk in the artifact.  \n\nI am not finding many viable alternatives for single target boss DPS.  I have been testing many damage rotations on Phry'zhia the ogre (Warlord's Ruin 2nd Encounter) and none of them come close to Still Hunt / Celestial.  Blade Barrage w/ shards of galanor, dragon's breath, whisper of the worm, even going as far to attempt the syntho grapple melee w/ stylish on the ogre.  \n\nEven with still hunt / celestial seemingly being the most optimal DPS option, 3 phasing Phry'zia would require near-perfect damage phases.  Seeing pre - The Final Shape videos of hunters 2 phasing the ogre has me wondering if there are better options currently.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, I am looking to  do a video on solo flawless Warlord's Ruin and am doing deep dives into damage to make it as fast as I possibly can (hunter specifically)."

            "Original": "Tl;Dr: People on this sub downplay the strength of Euphony for how easy it is to use. Euphony is not the absolute top for damage or dps, but it beats out a good majority of popular options and what people think it doesn't. It is simple and easy to use, much like Still Hunt is, and builds into the subclass at the same depth. It performs well in other areas where other options do not do as well, mainly having ways to build into excellent ad clear and major/ultra killing. Your damage in raids is liable to be affected by not just your own options for damage but also your team's. This leads to inflated self numbers that are unrealistic in most cases because your teammates are lagging behind or plateaued numbers that don't represent the potential of the weapon because your entire team is keeping up. Optimal damage is an unrealistic goal that will lead you to do mid damage because you don't understand fully how to execute it. Euphony does more than enough damage in a team setting to warrant its use as a great option. Most importantly, it's a SPECIAL AMMO WEAPON, and it does this much.\n\n\n\nI see a lot of people on this sub downplaying this weapon because they can only see it against Still Hunt for total damage and burst, especially against the Witness. There's more to this Exotic than just that. It fundamentally builds into Strand Warlock. Almost all the tools in the disposal of a Strand Warlock can create Threadlings. This sort of subclass based synergy is only matched by Still Hunt.\n\nBeyond that, it destroys minibosses, it spawns tons of Threadlings while killing any kind of target (with Strand fragments it can summon 7 Threadlings with one precision kill on a miniboss), and it's incredibly easy to use. This weapon is nearly as brain dead easy as Still Hunt is. People think it does the same dps/damage as a Heavy Linear Fusion. It does not, it does even more than 95% of Heavy LFR's in dps and or total damage. Euphony has more total damage starting from zero Spindle stacks than Sleeper Simulant and most Heavy Weapons. With Apotheosis setups on Strand Warlock, it out does the Sustained dps of Celestial Nighthawk Still Hunt. It's nor the top but it beats out a lot for how easy it is.\n\nAlso, some statistical analysis using Witness damage. The Witness has approximately 25.6 million health plus or minus 200k. Claimed total damage with Still Hunt and Apex Predator on Celestial Hunter has reached 9.5 million damage. If you were to succeed in killing the Witness with this, the rest of your team would have done 14.1 million damage between 5 people. That leaves 2.82 million damage per person over the entire length of the Encounter, which is pitiful. If another teammate did 6 million that would leave each person of 4 others doing 2.03 million damage which is terrible. In order for the optimal or maximum possible damage number for your build to appear, the majority of your team either needs to be doing mid or terrible damage. \n\nI know that's not from a lack of opportunity to do damage. Stop buying the advice of the optimal damage crowd completely. On most fireteams, you will not one phase the Witness. Most Destiny players cannot pull off an optimal damage build because they are not the top 2% players in the world. For some people it is simply just too hard and too complex. I am not encouraging anyone to use Thunderlord or Microcosm (unless Cenotaph +Well with x3 Surge using ammo finder) for the record. Use Whisper, or ironically Still Hunt Apex on any class. As long as your build can cross roughly 4.2 million damage in 2 damage phases you're fine. One or two members of your team should not be biting into everyone else's damage. Your entire team should be biting into each other's damage (not by getting them killed though). \n\nThat being said just Euphony with Apotheosis does 5 million damage against The Witness, in my hands, with a solid LFG team. With a different, better swap Heavy, it can do 7 million. But, if you don't want to use a swap Heavy, you don't need to. Using this setup with just Euphony is good enough damage, allowing you to use a Heavy for ad clear or other utility, which Still Hunt itself provides as a benefit too."

Then you spend the leaves on bounties. Then you complete the bounties to earn alloy. Gather enough alloy and you're given a quest to do bonfire bash. At the end of the activity you receive your armor piece. Wow, that's a lot.\n\nAnd to get the glowy armor you have to do all of this again, basically. But you don't just get an ornament, you have to spend synthweave to unlock these appearances. And this is only the white glow; to get the subclass-based glow you have to buy the set from the eververse store.\n\nMaybe I'm crazy but this doesn't seem like it respects our time. I get that reworking an event has a heavy cost, but maybe just tweak things here or there?"

            "Original": "I was farming Bonfire Bash, and it got me thinking. Solstice has been a fairly decent event in my opinion because it's the only one where you can get the armor for free, and the issue I have with Solstice is getting weapon rolls. The problem with other events is that the focus is only on weapons because the armor isn't even earnable.\n\nI think going forward an old set of event armor should be *at least* baked into the event card rewards, if not earnable for free like the Solstice armor. You can buy every set of event armor in the game for bright dust anyways, and we're talking about armor sets that have been in the game for YEARS at this point. I think being able to earn armor will make these events way more hype than they usually are. \n\nI also think if there was a way to make the Bonfire Bash weapon drops have multiple perks, this event would be nigh perfect. I have a Glacioclasm with double perks in both columns which resulted in a PvE/PvP God roll on the same gun, and the fact that this cannot happen in the main activity of Solstice kind of bugs me. Praise where it's due though, I actually desire a roll of each of the Solstice weapons, and that's a great feeling to have imo.\n\nSo yeah, the TLDR is earning old event armor by playing the event would make 3/4 of the seasonal events way better, and adding double perk drops in Bonfire Bash would make this event awesome as well. \n\nThanks for reading"

He got the guy to get up and let him take a photo of him and then he talked to him some more, I'm guessing trying to scam some money from him.  The reason I say this is because they both got off at the same stop with the scammer going towards the exit and the victim going towards the front which is basically the safety area.  I don't know but the scammer felt like he was being dishonest from the get go.  Whereas the random guy felt like he was just minding his own business.  I don't know I could be completely wrong but it just felt shady and the exit from the train wasn't in keeping with a mutually beneficial interaction."

            "Original": "Hi guys, \n\nJust wanted to know is this possibly a scam. I've got contacted by an Asian woman (on tinder) who is supposedly knowing that some SEY investment could be rising to a lot of money before it gets released to the \"global\" market. \n\nEverything around it seems suspicious and most of it is pointing to be a \"pig butchering scam\" but you know human nature second thinking everything in terms of yeah but what if it's legit am I missing out an opportunity of a lifetime etc. \nPlease let me know about your thoughts about it, the webpage is kinda off putting and also information on that website is nowhere to be found globally, reason for it was \"it's brand new\".\nAnd if it is a scam whom can I contact to report it and possibly shut it down or recategorizing it as phishing/scam/or something else before somebody else falls for it.\n\nWebsite in question is: www.energyinnovation.online\n\nI appreciate your answers and thoughts."

            "Original": "I have received a few scam emails all asking for bitcoin or they will leak \"personal info\" but this one is a bit different since the scammer has my phone number. Here is the email:\n\n[my name],\nI know that, [first 3 digits and last 4 digits of my phone number] is too personal to talk to you.\nI will directly come to the point. You don't know me however I know everything about you and you must be wondering why you're getting this mail, correct?\nI placed a Malware on porn website and there's more, you visited same adult web site to have pleasure (know what I mean?). While you were busy watching videos, your system began working as a RDP (Remote Device) with a backdoor which allowed me access to your display and your camera recordings. Right after that, the software collected all of your data and all of your contacts from device including your complete photos.\nExactly what I want?\nIt is just your bad luck that I stumbled across your bad deeds. Next, I gave in more time than I should've investigating into your personal life and generated a two screen video. First half displays the video you had been watching and 2nd half displays the video from your cam (it is someone doing inappropriate things). Wholeheartedly, I want to destroy about you and let you continue with your daily life. And I am about to offer you a way out that will accomplish it. The two option is either to turn a blind eye to this e mail (bad for you), or pay me a small amount.\nWhat can you do?\nLet’s investigate those 2 options in more detail. First Option is to disregard my email. Let us see what will happen if you choose this option. I will certainly send your video to all your contacts including family members, coworkers, etc. It doesn't help you avoid the humiliation your self will face when friends learn your sordid video in their inbox. Option 2 is to pay me, and be confidential about it. We’ll call it my “confidentiality fee”. Now Lets see what will happen if you pick this way out. Your dirty secret remains your secret. I'll keep my mouth closed. Once you send the payment, You go on with your routine life and family as if none of this ever occurred. You will make the transfer via Bitcoin.\n\nNotice: You now have 12 hours in order to transfer the amount. (I have a unique pixel in this mail, and right now I know that you've read through this e-mail). The task to acquire bitcoins can take some time so don't put it off. If I don't receive the BitCoins, I will, no doubt send your video to all of your contacts including close relatives, coworkers, and many others. however, if I do get paid, I'll destroy the video immediately. If you really want evidence, reply with \"yes!\" and I will send your video recording to your 10 friends everyday. It's a non negotiable one time offer, so please don't waste my time and yours by replying to this e-mail. You should be aware that my tracker will definitely be sharing what action you take after you're done reading this letter. Swear to god, If I see any suspicious activity from your browser history then I will have to send out your video recording to your friends and family, coworkers before your time ends.\n\n\nThey claim to have video recording of me but my pc doesn't have a camera lol so obvs is a scam but I'm just worried on how they acquired my phone number. Bare in mind that they didn't write down the whole number, only the first and last parts and XXX replaced with the 3 middle digits so maybe they don't know my whole number."

Since I don't have anyone to pick it up for me, I agreed. He said I needed to pay for a $50 deposit before he got there and the rest in cash once he got to my place. He sends me his bank account, BSB and his name and phone number. So I stupidly trust him. \nAfter sending the $50 to him. He deleted all his Facebook accounts and I couldn't be in contact with him anymore. I tried to ring him with the number he gave him and it said the call was busy. \nSo, tomorrow I thought I might go to the bank and ask if they could help me.

First few reasons why I believe it’s real, he had my phone number and my first name. I don’t think I’ve been on any of those sites (I’m not gay) but maybe I accidentally clicked a link where it later closed, I also feel like I’ve been on some sketchy websites where my camera may have been on. Also the fact that’s willing prove it if I just reply to the email with “yes!” Is kind of scary. \n\nBut a few things that my friends brought up that make this kind of skeptical for them (haven’t really been listening cuz they don’t care about this as much as I do) is the fact that they only say my first name, and the phone number only has the first 2 digits, the area code for Australia, and the last 4 digits, which literally any website gives, literally Xing out the other contents. They also chrcked the have I been pwned website and my email was subject to a Gemini data leak, where my “partial phone number” and email was leaked. \n\nI don’t know, I’m just quite spooked, I’ve already filed a report but I guess we’ll find out in 12 hours. Please let me know asap what you guys think.\n\nPS I’m a minor, obviously old enough to use reddit, but still problematic."

So I tell him and he goes on and on about how he wants to see me debt free. He keeps pressing the issue and gave me HIS bank info to use to pay off my debt. I call my bank and pretend that a relative wants to help me out and inquire if they can receive any of my information by linking the account and they said no.\n     So at this point I figured worst case scenario I pay it off and it's a lie; nothing happens. This was early morning/afternoon and I check recently and the payment went through and it's paid off. While I'm thrilled about the debt being gone it's made me extremely anxious. I don't understand why someone would just do this. \n     I feel like there is something I'm not seeing. Is he going to report it as fraud? Is it a long con to fuck me over? Like a month from now the debt is all back because of some fuckery. He wants me to pay off my other card too the same way and I'm ??? Please any advice is appreciated.\n     \n     Tldr; Man pays off my credit debt with his bank account details and I'm left confused."

Looking back there were a couple red flags we didn’t pick up on like currency conversion and not being able to use discount codes that are working (student discount). Any advice on what Univa actually is? I’ve told her to freeze her card for now until Lucy and yak get back to her."

The scam, part of a larger operation known as the \"Smishing Triad,\" involved sending fake text messages that appeared to be from the USPS, tricking recipients into revealing personal information. Smith, frustrated by the scam, managed to hack into the scam network, uncovering details about the operation and eventually turning over the information to U.S. authorities. His efforts highlighted both the scale of the scam and the vulnerabilities in current cybersecurity defenses, especially in combating large-scale smishing attacks.\n\nI’ve tried sharing this a few times yet the article keeps being removed by automod."

The courier mailed a check of $4400 to my friend and he deposited it today, and when the check clears, he's supposed to zelle the seller the remaining money. The courier company even gave my friend an extra $300 for the inconvenience. \n\nI thought it's a little fishy. I'm concerned for my friend getting scammed.

I guess I’m pretty desperate as I feel like a burden without a job so I’m kind of jumping at all opportunities so I looked away from these red flags and scheduled a zoom meeting with them for tomorrow but upon further research on Reddit I’ve seen similar scams where they get people on a zoom call and convince them to buy a bunch of office supplies or something like that.

I have spent days to troubleshoot but could not get anywhere. So now raising this discussion to get some help understanding what is happening here as I have hit the wall and cannot find any helpful information on internet.\n\n**1 - Event Viewer showing AAD token broker errors**\n\nThese errors presenting issue with AAD token not being able to return. Also, all the client ID mentioned in these alerts are for Microsoft managed application like:- Edge, Teams, OneDrive.\n\n  \n[https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/0d11cea1-731a-4fdb-9659-82e8f8313c4c?platform=QnA](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/0d11cea1-731a-4fdb-9659-82e8f8313c4c?platform=QnA)\n\nHowever, I have checked and we are not experiencing any authentication issues with Microsoft managed apps hence not sure why event viewer is complaining.\n\nTo give you the summary of our company setup. We are using Configuration manager with Intune and we are hybrid joined.\n\n**2 - Software center unable to check device compliance.**\n\nWe have Software center deployed to manage application request and for device compliance check.\n\nAfter discovering these errors I have tested few things:\n\n1. No issues when re-imaging device. Device can join company and shows in AAD and Intune\n2. No issues adding new device to company\n3. Can still deploy app and user can install them\n4. **ONLY ISSUE we have is Software center cannot check the device compliance anymore and throwing below error.** \n\n[https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/9676077b-9945-4635-9b25-b590e9340372?platform=QnA](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/9676077b-9945-4635-9b25-b590e9340372?platform=QnA)\n\nWhen checking device compliance from Configuration manager and Intune, device is showing compliant which is why its getting more difficult to troubleshoot as why Software Center is failing for compliance check.\n\nI have checked Software center logs from CCM folder and it shows below error for unable to get jwToken:\n\n[https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/96b9470f-522c-42d6-9075-2b651594a824?platform=QnA](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/96b9470f-522c-42d6-9075-2b651594a824?platform=QnA)\n\nAny further help or directions will be appreciated.\n\nThanks"

            "Original": "Hi All\n\nWe're a small internal IT team at a larger orgnisation. As part of this we're looking to oursource our SIEM/SOC/SOAR to a provider that can manage this and provide that level of security monitoring that we're unable to do in-house.\n\nWe took our needs analysis around functionality and had a consultant help review products and we came back to either Crowdsrike Next-Gen SIEM or a managed FortiSIEM solution.\n\nThis is where I'm a bit stuck. We're currently using CS Falcon Complete, but also use Fortigate for our Firewalls and eventually our endpoint VPN's. If we move to a partner for our solution, we would be removing Falcon Complete and just licence the endpoint protect, with the partner taking care of the alerts.\n\nOut options are:\n\n* Crowdstrike MDR + Falcon Complete + Identity + Spotlight + FileVantage\n* Managed FortiSIEM with SOC/SOAR with a global company, but their Austrlian arm runs their SOC locally, 24/7 eyes on glass\n\nCrowdstrike is about 70% of the price of the traditional SOC option, but I'm just not 100% sure if what they are offering are of the same level and not sure how to accuratly see what is missing. For us, one of the most important things is to have almost \"zero-touch\" of the solution, but still having access to our data, should we want to investigate other issues. We want something where things are automatically handled and resolved, without relying on our team to be watching dashboards all day long.\n\nWe would like to feed in data such as our firewalls, event logs from windows and our O365 logs as a minimum\n\nThe traditional option also gives us access to security consultants for any other work (costed seperately) and a few other non-tangable things.\n\nHas anyone ever looked at the two options and come up with a prefrence? (Lets also just ignore the CS outage as I believe it would still have bitten us if we used their endpoint protect)\n\nS"

I'm not sure how it happened but there are a bunch of phones on our MDM system that do not belong to our company. And it just seems like random people's phone in random states. I am assuming it is because some phones were returned by our company but they were not properly wiped and they were refurbished and sold. So the issue we were having is that, we have admin control over completely random strangers phones. Obviously we want to get these people off of our system but it would require wiping their device and then removing the Apple business manager license so their phone won't show up in our Verizon MDM anymore. What would be the best way of going about this? Obviously if you see a message or notification by a random company you never heard about telling you to wipe your phone you would probably ignore it. \n\nWhat I did for now was just send a text message to those phone numbers that show up in our MDM system to give them a one week notice. Our receptionist did call some of the numbers to let the person their phone was on our system, so they should be aware enough about the issue and should backup their data. And some phones don't even have phone numbers attached in the system or are glitched, it is just blank or too many digits, so we have no way of contacting them but can tell that one someone is using the phone by the apps installed. Is this fair to just wipe the phones remotely?"

I started in the MSP space, where I gained most of my on-prem and some 365 cloud experience. My roles have ranged from answering phones and handling tickets to having full autonomy in coordinating infrastructure and major software upgrades. I’ve maintained servers and designed solutions for small companies.\n\n\n\nHowever, I feel that many of my skills are “old school” on-premise skills.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I’m back in an office setting, supporting Hyper-V servers, workstations, and performing basic 365 tasks like managing users (add, edit, delete). We don’t use any of the more advanced 365 or Azure features—just basic Teams, SharePoint, and Exchange Online.\n\n\n\nI’m looking to get some certifications that will help with my day-to-day tasks and maybe teach me some new tricks, even though we’re not using the more advanced 365 features. I also want to use these certs to position myself for higher pay and new opportunities. I’ve been with my current company for 6 years, and I feel I’ve maxed out in terms of what I can do here.\n\n\n\nI’m considering some intermediate/expert 365 certifications, particularly those focused on security and endpoint management. After that, I might pursue another cert to make myself more competitive for an upper-level analyst role or an IT manager/assistant manager position.\n\nI am concerned that whatever cert that I get, that I won't be able to use all the skills that I learned at my current company. That means I can't state on my resume that I am using my cert to the fullest and I am at the same level as a fresh grad.\n\nMy current pay is $80K CAD gross, thanks to inflation adjustments and a slight market adjustment after I mentioned to my manager that I was exploring other opportunities.  Supposedly, if I stick around longer and after our manager retires, I will have the ass manager role butI think I will be waiting around for another 6-7 years.  Also, I’m in my 40s, so I’m not exactly a spring chicken.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do next?\n\n  \nThanks,"

Everything installed good and everything works. But boy is NetWare's GUI slow! \n\nFor that reason, I wanted to administer the server via the web consoles provided by  the OS (iManager, Remote Manager.etc) Only issue is when I go and to these web sites on Chrome on my host machine, it gives me the \"ERR\\_SSL\\_VERSION\\_OR\\_CIPHER\\_MISMATCH\". Which of course Chrome says its an unsupported protocol. \n\nNow I tried to play around with the settings on the server but it either doesn't work or breaks my installation and have to reinstall it. I've done many searches on Google and can't seem to find a solution. I know NetWare SSL protocols are very old so I'm sure that has something to do with it. \n\nFor a server that old and is just on my local network, I don't think SSL and secured websites are necessary. My question is, how do I go about disabling SSL on all web services on NetWare? Again, I tried playing with the Apache settings, Tomcat settings and all that good jazz but to no avail. Any suggestions on how to even use this server with a modern day web browser? This is a project that's just for fun so this thing isn't going into serious production anywhere. Mostly using it as a retro computing file sharing server later down the road. \n\n  \nThanks all!"

            "Original": "Hi All,\n\n  \nWe have a requirement to upgrade our surveillance hardware from an NVR setup to a centralized storage array. Over a span of one year we plan to integrate around 1200 cameras from transmitting data to 70+ dedicated NVRs to one centralized storage array solution (Scale out NAS or SAN). Our campus covers over 12 Kilometers in distance.\n\nThe main challenges faced in our existing case are:\n\n* Recurring purchase, installation, and maintenance of NVRs.\n* Scattered and locally placed NVRs pose security threats and maintenance difficulties.\n* Increasing physical space requirements to place NVRs and racks.\n* Low data retrieval rate, which is time-consuming.\n* Facing difficulties while sharing data with government agencies.\n* Time-consuming process for configuration changes.\n* Integration and compatibility issues with third-party devices and applications.\n\nRequirements -\n\n1. Bulk or single storage solution to eliminate the NVR setup.\n2. Fast data storage and quick retrieval.\n3. Minimal physical space needed.\n4. Easy scalability.\n5. High data security.\n6. Phase I: Urgent requirement of over 1PB of data retention for 250 camera footages with 6 months retention rate).\n7. Primary and secondary storages (live and backup).\n\nShort term focus -\n\n* Compatibility with VMS software that has a strong growth trend towards AI integration\n* Compatibility with UNV brand cameras, the average out of the 1200 cameras have a 2MP, 1080@25fps HD resolution recording function\n* To save budget our, hardware preference would be SAS based HDDs instead of a hybrid SSD/HDD approach\n* We would primarily want to procure a SAN based storage instead of a scale out NAS for a long term solution.\n\nLonger term focus:\n\n* Analytics - We want to have a stronger mechanism for finding the footage we need, our current VMS software does not provide any analytics features as the support plan is limited.\n* Faster Retrieval rate - Currently the data stored in the NVRs is very difficult to locate and recover in a quick manner when dealing with any government officials.\n* Cloud integration for other branch locations\n\n  \nAny recommendations for a mid to large-size surveillance deployments would be much appreaciated!"

I know errors, their button,s and options vary, but what is the best practice to go about resolving this. I thought maybe I could write something that would target the \"okay\" button and write a task that that upon seeing the event executes the script or looking into making the event invisible but a lot of my searching for at least some starting guidance is limited and I was hoping someone here may have executed some kind of solution for this exact thing and might be able to put me on the right path."

We have the problem that it sometimes happens that printers are renamed incorrectly / location data is stored incorrectly or that printer queues are sometimes accidentally deleted because the wrong printer has been selected. Errors can happen, but we should be able to detect errors before users report them.\n\n\nI am looking for a system in which I can audit the configuration of the printer queues on the server. What I have found so far only provides audit options for print jobs."

I'd like to see some other opinions but here's what I think: eggster has good enough mechanics and game sense to go pro, but his agent pool is terrible.  His mechanics kind of remind me of a slightly worse version of Jawgemo's (from the bit of Jawgemo I've seen).  I personally think he will never be able to go pro even if he wanted to just because of how bad his agent pool is, and the fact that I don't think his mechanics are good enough to be a good fragging duelist at the top level (what he currently does in ranked).  I'm really interested to see what everybody else thinks!"

Then I eventually die from being \"AFK.\" I've gotten a warning twice now for being AFK in the game, but there's nothing I can do. Is anyone else having this problem or am I doing something wrong.

Half of my games mostly go by teaching my teammates where the sites are and where to peek, etc.(iron lobby). Does the aim really stays almost the same when you move up lobbies? And whenever I play a silver player I can't even peek coz I feel like I am getting tapped almost every single time.

My mechanics are solid. I have to imagine that because of this, the hidden MMR is putting me against better players. But wtf, that system is ass.

I can't make callouts without being harassed or bullied and while I've just defaulted to turning my mic off typing in chat sucks. I know most people will say just mute them or ignore it but it's so disheartening that I can't play or make callouts without being harassed. \n\nIt's not every game but it's a good majority of them.

I have been playing valorant on pc for a while but started on ps5 just recently.\n\nI’m not sure if I have dumb thumbs or what but the precision aiming that is part of valorant is pretty tough on a controller for me. Any advice for aim settings or any other tips? Does the game have a type of aim assist?\n\nAlso it seems like crouching is much more important on console for spray control. Any truth to that?"

            "Original": "Hello Everyone,  \n[jmev#1337's Competitive Multiplayer Overview - Valorant Tracker](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/jmev%231337/overview)\n\nI am a casual gamer but very competitive. I've been watching videos, practicing, and trying to get better. I have been struggling to win ever since I reached the B3/S1 rank. My challenges seem to stem from game sense and the duelist role of creating space. Here are a few issues I've identified:\n\n1. When watching higher-elo players, they seem to have an easier time getting onto the site than I do. Although I don’t have any excuses, one issue I face is that most of my team’s agents aren’t ideal. I try to communicate when I'm going in, but I don’t get traded because our pacing is completely off. I also struggle with not getting a smoke or Sova dart when needed. I often don’t ask for these, so that might be my fault. My question is: How can I get onto the site to create space when the team composition isn't ideal?\n2. As a duelist, we often have more than one on the team. Is it wrong for me to lurk occasionally? I ask because lurking is the only time I’ve had major success, as opposed to trying to create space and dying without achieving much. However, I hope this will change as I progress.\n3. My aim is improving, but I find the Phantom might work better for me than the Vandal as a duelist. I am working on my Vandal skills but still struggle more than I should. When I play Jett and use the Outlaw/AWP, I perform much better, but I worry this is becoming a crutch that I'm relying on too heavily. Should I keep at it with the Vandal or use whatever is better for myself?\n4. This question concerns agent selection. I’ve been told that Renya is a good choice until Gold. However, I believe that if I invest time now in mastering agents that will benefit me in the long run, it might be more advantageous. I’ve mainly been playing Jett but have unlocked Raze. Do you think it’s smarter to continue with Jett/Raze or should I focus on Renya to improve my skills as a duelist?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgscj267s4id1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e354a87f19c24c4fac952196510be45ed8afdc\n\nThank you so much for any tips, tricks, advice or help."

So here are 2 clips from attack and defense in my most recent ranked match.\n\n  \nI am just curious if you all might think I'm getting burnt out or if I simply need improvement. The reason I think I may be burnt out is that I went from Gold 1 to Gold 3 in 2 days, and then the whole next week, I didn't win a single game and went back down to Gold 1. The clips I have here are from a losing game as well, and I feel like I didn't play terribly like the others. It was one of my first times playing KJ in the comp, so some things may be wonky (I'm usually a controller/initiator). Please tell me if I just need a break, or if you see anything to improve and how to practice said thing.\n\n[PS: My mic is muted in the vid.](https://reddit.com/link/1epztd1/video/pipbezj2l4id1/player)\n\nThanks :)"

Against minors that rises to **121%** more dps.\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, according to MossyMax's damage charts an energy legendary 120 scout does 520 dps to minors.  After the last few rounds of buffs most primaries are now sitting in the 500-600 dps range, so this is already quite good.  DMT does **1267** dps (taking the kinetic bonus into account).\n\n\nAgainst majors (champs, minibosses, bosses), DMT is respectable as well, doing trace rifle dps when ramped up and you can add another 20% from vorpal to that.\n\n\nTL;DR version:  DMT absolutely deletes red bars now.  It's like a 140 hand cannon that hits more than twice as hard and with another ~10m of range."

            "Original": "Basically I watched through Datto's video on his Raid Encounters Tier list and was wondering how the raids as a whole would rank based on how he ranked the encounters. So I gave each tier a score S=6, A=5, etc. and added all the encounters up and divided by the amount encounters the raid had to give an average score for the raid. Not a perfect system as there are a lot of ties and I ignored the \"Not Really an Encounter tier.\"\n\nHere is the list:\n\n1. Spire of Stars 4.33\n2. Scourge of the Past 4.25\n2. Vow of the Disciple 4.25\n3. Last Wish 4.16\n4. Kings Fall 4\n4. Wrath of the Machine 4\n4. Leviathan 4\n4. Salvation's Edge 4\n5. Vault of Glass 3.8\n6. Deep Stone Crypt 3.4\n7. Eater of Worlds 3.33\n7. Crown of Sorrow 3.33\n8. Crota's End 3.25\n9. Garden of Salvation 3\n10. Root of Nightmares 2.75\n\nHere is the link to Datto's Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klvCQzfVbf4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klvCQzfVbf4)"

            "Original": "I have seen a few posts regarding farming Solstice bounties, and I have a farm that I have not seen mentioned anywhere else. This farm does follow the same methods of the others to choose orb generation bounties. However, to maximize your leaves, instead of resetting the bounties if the orb bounty is not listed, you will choose the bounty to get kills with elemental damage as well.\n\nTo start, you will need to have the following:\n\n1. Prismatic subclass with super matching the element of your seasonal weapon.\n1. Seasonal weapon, either crafted or dropped is fine.\n1. Harmonic Siphon helmet mod.\n1. Logic Reductor artifact mod.\n1. Golgoroth Maze Checkpoint.\n\nOnce you have all of these, you will travel to the Golgoroth Maze checkpoint and travel forward, take the first right, then the next left, then the next right, and finally, another right. After making that last right, you will travel down the hallway until you see a couple thrall in between 2 sections of columns.\n\nThese thrall will respawn within a second or two after being killed, and they do not move from that small area they are confined in. This is what makes the farm great. Once here, you can choose your orb generation bounties, or the elemental damage bounty if the orb bounty is not listed. While the elemental damage bounty has less chance of dropping the weapons or armor, it is better than spending 5 leaves to reset and hope that the orb bounty appears.\n\nAfter you have the bounties, you only need to equip your seasonal weapon that has Radiolaria Transposer, and then kill the thrall. You might have to kill two waves of them to get the Radiolaria Transposer to pop, but once it does, you can sit back and let farm work its magic. With the artifact mod, the constantly respawning thrall will keep it going for longer and continuously, so you can stand there and wait for all your bounties to finish. Your seasonal weapon's element and your super for prismatic will need to match so that your harmonic siphon will generate orbs, but you will get about 2% of the bounty with each respawn. On top of this, if you use a crafted seasonal weapon, this is a great farm for weapon levels too as the Radiolaria Transposer kills count towards the weapon XP and total kill count.\n\nDoing this farm, your elemental damage bounties will complete in seconds, while the orb generation may take about 3 minutes to complete. Once done, you can grab more bounties without needing to speak to Eva and you can farm this repeatedly, as long as you have leaves available.\n\nTo make things easier, I have also added this video of the process using Corrasion and an arc super with prismatic:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wwyLRpNR2PQ"

Kills with other weapons slightly increases this weapons blast radius for a short duration (3s), kills with this weapon provide an extended duration (6s) with improved blast and velocity. \n\nThis will make it's auto reload for 3 target hits more viable, increase dmg chance so you can be a little less accurate for tagging and weapon swapping, doesnt make it to OP."

Trying to get precision kills in any of the ritual gamemodes is fairly easy with any other weapon and enough rounds played, but sniper rifles are one of the most antithetical weapons to the fast-paced environments you have to deal with. Having to hold still, scope in, and deal with flinch throwing off your aim is only suitable to specific maps in Crucible. Getting precision kills with *sidearms* is easier than sniper rifles. This node needs to be taken out entirely."

The ole homeowner is still going after them for the eviction and she is using that to get people to donate more money to her. It makes me sick and she needs to be held accountable. She recently has been arrested for domestic assault, child endangerment and many more things. I’ve reported the account and it’s still up. I’ve emailed the people that did an article on her and they basically said oh well we can’t co tell what she does. \nThis person is lying and making people believe she has her kids and is now being evicted…. I have proof of all these claims by the way if I need to show them to the proper people or organization. I can’t sit and watch her take advantage of innocent people anymore."

It wasn’t my first or second time seeing the add so I decided to click on it. To my surprise the website looked pretty well put together and the impulsive millennial in me shot out like lightning. Now, before you say it, yes that was extremely stupid, but I’m all about a good deal and I’ve bought so many items from websites like these and things have actually gone well. At first, I had like $200 USD worth of items in my cart, but considering this was my first time using the website I decided that I’m going to give it a test run first and brought it all down to $40 USD (I was actually okay with losing that amount) However, I got curious and decided to Google and do some research and nobody really could confirm or deny the websites credibility. I immediately got nervous. I tried to email the storefront to get a refund but no one replied. A few days go by and I check the tracking that was given and it’s in transit. I will keep everyone updated as I REALLY hope I didn’t do something stupid. In the meantime, I’m getting a new debit card and hope my information isn’t all on the dark web or something already.

My response was: “I’d prefer getting more details here before moving to any phone discussions” and she replied “Yes, I would prefer a phone call.” Which makes no sense in regards to what I said.\n\nWhat do you all think?

As a kid, my dad was often times unemployed and my Mom struggled just to make ends meet cleaning houses. He would be out doing meth and cheating on my Mom, he also stole from us to pay for his addiction. Even when he had a great truck driving job, he didn't send us much money for food so I know what it is like to have to go to bed hungry and the guilt my Mom felt not being able to feed us during hard times. She did her best BTW and was able to leave him and took us with her. Anyways, I asked this woman how much she needed and she said in broken English, \"Go to self check out.\" and was being a little pushy about it. That's when my gut told me to stop and get away from her. I told her polity \"I'd very sorry but I can't afford to help.\" Had to repeat this 3 times. When I left Target, I felt so low but then it hit me, \"Why would she be there with all that baby stuff knowing that she didn't have the money to pay for it?\" Was this really a scam or do you guys think that she really needed help?"

And that it’s $50 monthly for alarm and can cancel anytime. \n\nTurns out he signed us up for a 4,000 contact for the equipment on  top of the 70$ Monthly. He spent 3 hours talking my husband’s head off and sent his guys in to set the cameras up and I feel so stupid. I  \n\nHe also told our neighbors that we bought the system and told us that they bought it to get us both to sign up. And also, all these stories about people breaking into cars in our street- we live in a basically retirement town in the rural Oregon- which sounds like total bs.\n\nMy advice? Trust your gut and don’t give anyone your credit card info"
