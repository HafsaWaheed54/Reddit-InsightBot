            "Original": "So I just received a letter from Printing Center USA [www.printingcenterusa.com](https://www.printingcenterusa.com) telling me that everyone who used their website between September and November 2023 has had ALL of their information stolen. \n\nThe hacker gained access to first and last names, address, credit card number, expiration date, security code and card ID number. \n\nI have never heard of a hack getting this much information. Surely none of their data must have been encrypted? Was it all in the same file or something? I feel like this level of negligence must open them up to legal ramifications. I run an online business and I have no idea what users' card numbers and security codes are because I let a payment processor deal with all of that sensitive info. I do not want it. As is customary, it took a month to send out the letter informing customers that they had lost our data. \n\nThis is probably not a big enough deal to make headlines, but I feel that I should share it in case anyone else is searching for info."

I've called the administrator, emailed them, read the judgement repeatedly and have nothing. Jan 22, 2024 was the deadline so any date after that? Does anyone have an idea?"

Much of it is “sensitive,” making it “valuable for malicious actors,” per Cybernews, which first discovered the breach on an unsecured website.\n“The dataset is extremely dangerous as threat actors could leverage the aggregated data for a wide range of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts,” the researchers, comprised of cybersecurity expert Bob Dyachenko and the team at Cybernews, explained.\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe latest data breach is considered the largest of all time. IncrediVFX – stock.adobe.com\n\nCybernews’ head of security research Mantas Sasnauskas told the Daily Mail that “probably the majority of the population have been affected.”\nThe one glimmer of hope, though, is that the 12 terabytes of data, which appears to be a meticulous compilation of many breaches (COMB), does not contain anything “newly stolen.”\nCybernews said it “discovered billions upon billions of exposed records on an open instance,” which means it was open for anyone to see.\n\n\n3\n\nExperts are urging users to stay vigilant about phishing scams and to change their passwords. terovesalainen – stock.adobe.com\nWhile the owner is likely to never be identified, the team hypothesized that they could be a data broker, malicious cybercriminal or someone with access to large amounts of data.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\tMake your passwords secure with this one quick hack — and bring positivity to your life, too\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest amount of data exposed is from the Chinese instant messaging platform Tencent, with 1.4 billion records compromised.\nWeibo trailed behind with 504 million records leaked, MySpace with 360 million, Twitter with 281 million, music streaming platform Deezer with 258 million and LinkedIn with 251 million.\nOther major sites include Adobe, Telegram and Dropbox, as well as lesser-known sites like Doordash, Canva and Snapchat and various government organizations around the world, including those in the US.\nCybernews has compiled a searchable list online where users can look up potentially compromised sites.\nUsers can also look up email addresses and phone numbers using Cybernews’ personal data leak checker.\nThe scale of the leak’s impact is likely to be “unprecedented,” according to Cybernews, and the sheer volume of data compromised makes past breaches look minuscule in comparison.\nIn November, the outlet reported a COMB that revealed 3.2 billion records, which was considered the “largest breach of all time” when discovered.\n\n\n3\n\n“We should never underestimate what cybercriminals can achieve with such limited information,” Eset’s global cybersecurity advisory Jake Moore told Computer Weekly. Gorodenkoff – stock.adobe.com\n“If users use the same passwords for their Netflix account as they do for their Gmail account, attackers can use this to pivot towards other, more sensitive accounts,” they explained. \n“Apart from that, users whose data has been included in supermassive MOAB may become victims of spear-phishing attacks or receive high levels of spam emails.”\nExperts have long advised against re-using the same, easily guessed passwords for multiple accounts, while recommending the use of a password manager to create and store strong logins.\n“We should never underestimate what cybercriminals can achieve with such limited information,” Eset’s global cybersecurity advisory Jake Moore told Computer Weekly.\n\nHe urged people to change their passwords promptly, stay vigilant against phishing emails and turn on two-factor authentication for all accounts, regardless of whether they were affected by the latest breach.\n“Many systems share platforms and are aggressively attempted with the latest attacks,” he continued. “Lots of networks rely heavily on updates, but when a vulnerability is located, it is a race against time to patch the issue before the data is compromised.”\n \n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\ncybersecurity\n\n\ndata\n\n\ndata breach\n\n\nleaks\n\n\npasswords\n\n\n1/23/24 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhy Gen Zers are through working 9 to 5: 'Not something I ...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Concerts\n\n\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post\n\n\n\t\t\tGet seats.

During the data breach, a hacker was able to access sensitive consumer data contained on the Zeroed-In Technologies, LLC computer system and access full names and Social Security numbers.\n            \n\nHow Do I Qualify for Zeroed-In Data Breach Investigation?\n            If you received a letter from Zeroed-In Technologies, LLC notifying you that your private information was impacted in their data breach, use the links below in order to find out if you may be eligible for compensation.\n            \n\n            Data breaches are serious matters that can cause long term damage. Hackers break into networks so that they can steal your personal information to sell it on the dark web, commit identity theft, financial theft or other frauds.\n            \n\n            Although ZeroedIn Technologies doesn't mention who was affected, based on the company's business model, it would seem that the breach affected many employees.\n            \n\nWhat Should I Do If My Data Was Hacked?\n            If you believe you have been the victim of the data breach, and may have received a notice, there are several steps you should take to protect yourself and mitigate the potential damage. These apply more broadly to a wider plethora of data breach cases:\n            \n\n\nStay Calm: Discovering your data has been compromised in a data breach can be alarming, especially if it is not your fault, but it's important to remain calm and take immediate action to protect your information.\nConfirm the Breach: Verify that the data breach has actually occurred and that your personal information has been compromised. Look for official announcements from the affected organization or reputable sources reporting the breach.\nChange Your Passwords: Start by changing the passwords for the affected account(s) immediately. Choose strong, unique passwords that are not easily guessable. It's best to use a password manager to securely store and generate passwords.\nEnable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Activate two-factor authentication for all your online accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a temporary code sent to your mobile device, in addition to your password.\nMonitor Your Accounts: Regularly monitor your financial and online accounts for any suspicious activity. Keep an eye out for unauthorized transactions, unfamiliar logins, or changes to your personal information.\nNotify Your Bank/Credit Card Companies: If your financial information has been compromised, contact your bank and credit card companies immediately. Report the breach and inquire about any additional security measures they can provide, such as monitoring your accounts for fraudulent activity.\nCheck Your Credit Reports: Request a free copy of your credit report from one of the major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion). Review the report for any unauthorized accounts or inquiries. Consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze on your accounts for added protection.\nBe Vigilant Against Phishing Attempts: Data breaches often lead to an increase in phishing attempts. Be cautious of suspicious emails, messages, or phone calls asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.\nUpdate Software and Use Antivirus Protection: Ensure that your computer, smartphone, and other devices are running the latest software updates. Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software to protect against potential threats.\nStay Informed and Seek Assistance: Keep yourself updated on the progress of the data breach investigation. The affected organization may provide guidance or resources for affected individuals. If necessary, consider seeking legal advice or contacting relevant authorities for further assistance.\n\n\n\nClaim Form Website: JoinClassActions.com\n\n\n\nSubmit Claim Here\n\n\n\nHow Do I Find Class Action Settlements?\nFind all the latest Class Action Settlements you can qualify for by getting notified of new lawsuits as soon as they are open to claims:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAttorney Advertising.

Does your institution have a plan to mitigate, fix, and prevent data breaches from happening?For the healthcare industry, data bre­aches are more than privacy violations. The­y remind us about our ongoing fight against digital threats. Every bre­ach, small or large, can shake patient trust and te­st our health systems' integrity.Re­cently, there has be­en a rise in breaches reported. This isn't just startling numbers; it's a wake­-up call. It shows how delicate our health information prote­ction is. This article aims to unpack these healthcare data bre­aches. We will also provide insights and practical ways to safeguard data. Knowing how to prevent and respond to a healthcare breach is crucial for building public trust and safe­ty. So, let's take a deeper dive into he­althcare data security. Not only will we explore the latest healthcare data breach solutions – we’ll do a deep dive into how organizations should respond and how they can prevent future breaches from occuring. What are the latest healthcare data breach statistics?The statistical data on cybercrime in healthcare reveals a chilling trend. Over the past few years, there has been a yearly 10% increase in healthcare data breaches. Prime targets include electronic health records as well as ERP in healthcare. When we sort data breaches, the following trends emerge:Phishing attacks top the list, causing more than half of he­althcare data breaches.Approximately 40% of breaches involve emails, making it the top concern of 90% of healthcare IT professionals. Nearly 30% of data breaches can be tie­d back to outside vendors, underscoring the importance of vetting partners. Insider actions account for 15% of healthcare breache­s reported.The remaining causes of data breaches in healthcare can be classified into physical theft, improper disposal of records, and unauthorized access or disclosure.Understanding the different types of healthcare data breaches is crucial to developing a security plan to safeguard sensitive data.A Closer Look at the­ Figures:In August 2023, there we­re reports of 26 data breache­s that involved 10,000 or more re­cords. Recent healthcare breaches continue to get larger in scope. Generally, a data bre­ach impacts around 74,000 patient records.What's surprising is that over the­ past three years, more­ than 90% of healthcare organizations had at least one­ breach.The Largest Healthcare Data Breach of All Time:Nearly 78.8 million patient records from Anthem Blue Cross’s computer systems were stolen by a sophisticated hacking/IT incident. According to the Department of Justice, social security numbers, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and patient data were stolen.The anthem breach is over 7 times larger than the Optum360 breach, which affected 11.5 million records. The top 5 largest data breaches in history are:Anthem (78 million records)Optum360 (11.5 million records)Premera Blue Cross (11 million records)Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (10.2 million records)Excellus Health Plan (9.3 million records)Understanding the Emotional, Financial, and Reputational Costs:Let’s look beyond the data breach statistics in healthcare. There’s also the human aspect. Breaches lead to a 20% decrease in patient trust. Financially, the global average cost of any given data breach is $4.45 million. For the healthcare sector, the damage was even more profound, with the average data breach cost nearing $11 million.What Are the Top Vulnerabilities in Healthcare:ERP in healthcare: A pivotal system that integrates various operations in healthcare but can be a gateway if not securely handled.Electronic Health Records: They contain sensitive patient information and have been a frequent target of cybercriminals.In essence, recent healthcare data breaches underscore the urgent need for fortified defenses and increased vigilance in the healthcare industry. With data breaches becoming the new norm, it's not a matter of if, but when the next one strikes. So, the question looms: is your organization prepared?Expert strategies play a pivotal role in shielding healthcare organizations from the threat of data breaches. It's undeniable; the healthcare industry is experiencing an unprecedented wave of cyberattacks. Data breaches in healthcare are not a new phenomenon, but the frequency, scale, and sheer audacity of these attacks have surged.Here's what experts and cyber security professionals recommend:Invest in smarter security infrastructure. The trends are clear: there is an increase in the types of data breaches in healthcare. From phishing attacks to ransomware to insider threats, there are more ways than ever for unauthorized parties to gain access to private data. Organizations can either beef up their IT security or partner with no-code platforms like Blaze that are not only HIPAA compliant, but also rigorously iterate on their enterprise-grade security. Implement robust authentication protocols. To prevent unauthorized access in the healthcare sector, organizations can reduce data breach risks with robust authentication mechanisms. This includes two-factor authentication (2FA) as well as single sign-on (SSO). When integrated into internal tools, this helps protect sensitive patient data and health insurance details. Promote employee training and awareness. It’s not just up to the IT team to protect your data. Healthcare organizations that equip their teams to recognize and thwart potential threats are less likely to fall prey to such attacks. From being able to identify a ransomware attack to handling patient data responsibly, having a well-trained team is critical. Utilize internal data management tools. Internal tools like Blaze allow you to create a centralized data analytics dashboard where you can visually track your organization’s data. However, not all internal tools are created equal. It’s important to choose a provider that is specially HIPAA compliant and boasts enterprise-grade security that is scalable, robust, and reliable. Schedule regular risk assessments and compliance audits. The types of data breaches in healthcare continue to diversify. Furthermore, what’s considered “best practice” today may be considered obsolete tomorrow. Regular audits can pinpoint weak spots and ensure that your organization is compliant with healthcare sector regulations.Leverage no-code platforms for enhanced security. There are many reasons why no-code AI tools are increasing in popularity. Aside from the ease of creating your own app and healthcare software without any code, the right tools are are minimizing security threats. Traditional coding and IT solutions can result in numerous vulnerabilities. With Blaze, the no-code approach makes integration seamless, ensuring that security enhancements don’t come at the cost of operational efficiency.Boosting data security ne­eds constant attention and action. Using expe­rt approaches, alongside tools such as Blaze, he­lps ensure strong protection against many dange­rs healthcare data encounte­r today.Expert strategies are essential in combating the surge in healthcare data breaches, embodying both a shield against cyber threats and a commitment to maintaining trust in an increasingly digital world.If your healthcare organization was breached, would you know what to do?A data breach in he­althcare is like a storm. It's challenging and unce­rtain. If your healthcare data gets bre­ached, it's key to know what to do. Knowing what to do is practical. It combines law, e­thics, and business. It'll help during this tough time.Unde­rstand the seriousness of the­ breach. Health data breache­s aren't just about losing files. It's about the trust of possibly a million pe­ople. They trusted you with the­ir sensitive data such as credit card and he­alth info.React Right away and Assess: Put togethe­r a response team quickly. Your te­am should include legal, technical, and communications e­xperts. The first work of the te­am should be to evaluate the­ extent of the bre­ach. Knowing if the breach had to do with Protecte­d Health Information (PHI) or critical health departme­nt data is key.Notify the Correct Entitie­s: According to Health and Human Services (HHS) guide­lines and the Health Insurance­ Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule, health organizations should inform the­ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) about breaches touching 500 or more­ people within 60 days. Smaller bre­aches of fewer than 500 pe­ople should be reporte­d yearly. This law isn't just about compliance. It's a move towards re­mediation and transparency.Talk Openly With Impacte­d People: It's important to tell those­ affected, honestly and e­ffectively, about what happene­d. Reveal what type of information got take­n, like electronic he­alth records, credit card numbers, or payme­nt details. Also tell them what the­y can do next, like sign up for credit monitoring.Work With Law Enforce­ment: If law-breaking actions like hacking cause­d the damage, getting in touch with law e­nforcement and cyber fore­nsic teams is a must. They not only help look into the­ breach, but also give pointers on how the­ security was bypassed and how to bee­f up defenses.Che­ck and Boost Data Security Actions: After a breach occurs, it's time­ to reevaluate your curre­nt data security actions. This isn't just changing tech stuff; it's an overall re­assessment to strengthe­n your defense against common cause­s of data breaches in healthcare­. Here, data security he­althcare stats can show new risks and efficie­nt reaction methods.Kee­p Watch and Help Out: The time following a bre­ach is a journey, not just a single eve­nt. Stay alert for strange activities and ke­ep helping those affe­cted. A breach affects re­al people; kind, continued he­lp makes a real impact.Learn and Pre­vent: A data breach is a tough teache­r. Use this situation to teach your team and improve­ your preventive plans. Learn more data security healthcare statistics and pinpoint areas where your team can improve. This can range­ from stronger online safety habits to using advance­d security tech. At a time whe­re data breaches in he­althcare using internet things stats are­ growing, staying in the lead with active de­fense is key.Note Ke­eping: Write down eve­rything done after the bre­ach happens. This thorough notice isn't just for matching regulations, but also for le­arning. Examine what was off, how the incident was manage­d and where changes are­ necessary. This sort of practice assists not only in addre­ssing possible legal issues, but also stre­ngthens the organization’s ability to withstand future e­vents.A healthcare data bre­ach is a sharp wake-up call to the risks in our linked digital e­ra. This situation calls for more than a quick fix, it needs a lasting, thoughtful, ongoing me­thod to protect the integrity of he­althcare information.Managing this rough time nee­ds a mix of obeying the law, quick reactions, ope­n dialogue, and a strong commitment to not just recove­ry but to enhancement and re­building trust. It's not just about handling a situation; it's about reinforcing a commitment to unwavering caution and a continual focus on safe­ty and privacy – the foundations of modern healthcare­.Choosing the right tools can help protect and strengthen health data management. Securing electronic health records (EHR) isn't just a technical issue; it's a cornerstone of trust in the digital healthcare landscape. Healthcare organizations know this; it's why the smart ones are leaning into sophisticated internal tools. These tools don't just clamp down on vulnerabilities; they transform how we protect protected health information.Let's break it down. ERP in healthcare – that's your enterprise resource planning systems – plays a critical role. It's where health data management becomes less of a chore and more of a streamlined, secure process. Blaze is the leading HIPAA compliant no-code app builder.

A breach in healthcare is a serious situation where someone's private health information is accessed or shared without permission. This can happen in different ways, like through computer hacking, lost or stolen devices, or mishandling patient records. It's important to know what a healthcare breach is to keep patient information safe and follow rules like HIPAA. This guide explains what happens during a breach, common causes, and how to prevent them to help healthcare workers protect sensitive patient information.In today's digital age, this question is vital for everyone involved in healthcare. As medical records and patient data go digital, understanding these breaches is crucial. But what exactly counts as a breach? How are healthcare systems breached in the first place? And what are indicators that a breach has occurred?Recognizing the early signs of such breaches can help prevent them, protecting both patients and providers. But first, it’s important to understand what kinds of incidents count as a healthcare breach.Why? Because these incidents affect not just the privacy of patients but also the trust they place in healthcare systems. What are the different types of data breaches in healthcare?In healthcare, databreaches can occur in various forms, including: Hacking or IT Incidents: Unauthorized access to health care systems through cyber attacks, such as ransomware or phishing. Lost or Stolen Devices: Misplaced or stolen laptops, smartphones, or USB drives containing sensitive patient information. Insider Threats: Employees or contractors accessing or disclosing patient data without authorization, either maliciously or accidentally. Human Error: Mistakes like sending patient information to the wrong recipient or improperly disposing of medical records.  Physical Theft: Stealing physical documents or devices from healthcare facilities.What Constitutes a Data Breach in Healthcare?Not every data incident counts as a data breach. That’s what makes the answer deceptively tricky.Think of it this way: We all know what a forest fire is. But at what point does a “normal” fire turn into a forest fire? What’s the tipping point between a tree – or a few trees – being on fire and then a blaze being classified as a forest fire?Similarly, when we answer “what is a data breach in healthcare,” we’re looking for that singular tipping point.A data breach in healthcare is a specific kind of incident that compromises patient privacy. What sets this apart from other incidents is that an unauthorized person has access to confidential patient information. In other words, something is only considered a “data breach” if an unauthorized party accesses patient data. On the other hand, if data is mishandled but not exposed to an unauthorized person, then it is not considered a data breach.Examples of a data breach in healthcare include, but are not limited to:A hacker gaining entry into a provider's electronic health record system.An employee looking at a patient's records without any work-related reason.Sharing patient information without consent or necessity. Sending a patient's health records to the wrong person or organization.Leaving printed patient information in a public area.It’s important to note that a security breach in healthcare is different from a “data incident.”“Data incident” is a broader term that includes any security event that could potentially compromise patient data. However, if there's no evidence that the data was actually accessed or used improperly, it's considered an incident, not a breach. Examples of a data incident include, but are not limited to:A laptop containing health records is stolen. However, the laptop is recovered before any logs or data can be accessed. An employee accidentally emails PHI to themselves, but reports the incident before any harm is done.The key to recognizing privacy breaches in healthcare is to determine whether unauthorized parties have accessed patient information.It's also important to note how healthcare data breaches are not just another IT problem. They are concerning because of the nature of the sensitive health information involved. Unlike a system outage, which affects accessibility, or a software bug, which might affect functionality, a data breach has direct implications for patient privacy and trust.So, what are data breaches in healthcare? It’s when an unauthorized person accesses protected health information (PHI). Investing in robust healthcare data management is key to preventing such breaches.Why Is Healthcare A Prime Target for Hackers and Cyber Attacks?If we look into why the healthcare sector is targeted in data breaches, it's because of the valuable patient information they have. This information can include everything from names and addresses to more sensitive details like health history.Our healthcare data breach case study reveals that stolen medical files are more valuable than another other type of file. Specifically, according to healthcare security statistics, the price of a patient file on the black market is $250 per file. That’s a whopping 46 times more valuable than stolen credit cards, which are valued at $5.40.So, what is the main cause of healthcare data breaches? It's typically old computer systems and legacy programs that need to be updated. While it’s impossible to be entirely breach-proof, investing in a modern, no-code internal app can exponentially reduce your risk. Healthcare data is a jackpot for hackers, brimming with invaluable patient information. A HIPAA-compliant, no-code tool like Blaze can be your digital shield, effortlessly fortifying your data defenses.What Are Common Indicators of a Breach in Healthcare? Kee­ping patient data safe is key. Be­ on the lookout for certain signs that could hint at a data leak. He­re's what to watch for:Too many failed login tries: It might me­an someone is attempting to access data they shouldn't see.Data is being sent to parties without reason: It could be he­alth details being transferre­d wrongfully.Unusual edits are being made in patient records:It may mean someone's me­ssing with confidential health details.System/software alerts. It's typically the­ first hint of a potential data leak.Sudden, odd tweaks in system setup: It could suggest an outside­r is trying to sneak in and cover their tracks.If you find these issues, you may be the victim of a breach in healthcare. If so, you have­ to alert those affecte­d. A report on the leak ne­eds to be drawn up, outlining what happene­d. If the data leak exte­nds to 500 or more people, it ne­eds an inside response­, and officials and the public have to be notifie­d.Watching for these­ signs can catch healthcare data leaks e­arly. It lets healthcare folk move­ fast to lock down patient records and lesse­n harm to those affected. Spotting the­ symptoms in time is vital to keeping he­althcare data secure.Actionable Steps to Monitor and Prevent Data BreachesHealthcare­ organizations must fortify their data security against growing cyber thre­ats. Here are some­ practical steps they should consider:Update­ and Patch Regularly: Get ahead of hacke­rs. Ensure you are up-to-date with se­curity patches.Security Training: Give staff the­ skills needed to ide­ntify and handle security threats with re­gular training.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA gives extra se­curity, challenging unauthorized access. The two most popular types are 2FA and SSO. Audits: Conduct re­gular audits and test for vulnerabilities.Compliant Tools: Use­ AI tools, like Blaze, a HIPAA compliant app builder, to build your systems securely.The­se steps help he­althcare providers comply with the HIPAA bre­ach notification rule. This rule states that affe­cted individuals, the Departme­nt of Health and Human Services (HHS), and in ce­rtain situations, the media, must be notifie­d of a breach if it affects many people­.Handling health care data effe­ctively is essential for me­eting legal obligations and for maintaining patient trust and the­ safety of health insurance de­tails. Quick notification to affected parties is vital whe­n a breach happens. In some instance­s, sending a large, or class mail, might be re­quired.It's not just rules-following. It's about a future­ where medical file­s are safer, easie­r to manage. That's comforting for doctors and patients. Want bette­r data protection? Blaze gives a no-cost consult.

Which is how my data has been exposed as I booked a table online.\n\nThe data breach was in December 2022 I had no notification or alert by sevenrooms or the restaurant itself that my data had been exposed and only today have I been notified as it was found on the dark Web.\n\nWhat should I do?

An investigation is ongoing around a mass arbitration planned against Face App for alleged violations of BIPA - Biometric Information Privacy Act.\n            \n\nWhat is the Illinois GIPA Law?\n            The Illinois Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA) is a state law that governs the collection, use, and disclosure of genetic information by employers, insurers, and other entities in Illinois.\n            \n\n            Under the GIPA, entities are prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on their genetic information, and are required to keep genetic information confidential and secure. The law also provides individuals with the right to access and correct their genetic information, as well as the right to sue for violations of the law.\n            \n\n            In addition to GIPA, Illinois also has a number of other privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) and Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). These laws, along with federal laws such as HIPAA and GINA, aim to protect individuals' privacy and security when it comes to sensitive personal information.\n            \n\nPast Privacy Class Actions\n            there have been a number of high-profile class action settlements related to the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which is a similar law that regulates the collection, use, and storage of biometric data by private entities.\n            \n\n            Some notable GIPA/PIPA/BIPA class action settlements in Illinois include:\n            \n\n            • Google agreed to pay a huge $100 Million class action settlement over its enormously popular application, Google Photos. The allegation was that people who appeared in Google Photos, while residing in Illinois did not receive proper notice and consent as per government privacy protections.\n            \n\n            • Facebook or Meta: In 2022, Facebook agreed to pay $650 million to settle a class action lawsuit alleging that it violated BIPA by collecting and storing users' facial recognition data without obtaining their consent. The settlement paid out $397 to qualified Illinois Facebook users in late 2022.\n            \n\n            • Google: In 2021, Google agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a BIPA class action lawsuit alleging that it violated the law by collecting and storing biometric data from Google Photos users without obtaining their consent.\n            \n\n            • Six Flags: In 2018, Six Flags agreed to pay $36 million to settle a BIPA class action lawsuit alleging that it violated the law by collecting and storing visitors' fingerprints without obtaining their consent.\n            \n\n            • SnapChat: In 2022, Snapchat settled a massive $35 Million class action lawsuit over allegations that its “Lenses” and “Filters” features colleted users' biometric information, such as their facial information, without complying with legal requirements to inform and get appropriate consent from users.\n            \n\nWhat Data is Protected by PIPA, GIPA and BIPA?\n            Here is a breakdown of the types of data protected by the Illinois Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), the Illinois Genetic Information Privacy Act (GIPA), and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA):\n            \n\n\n\n\nType of Data\nPIPA\nGIPA\nBIPA\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Information, such as name, address, and Social Security number\nX\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Information, such as credit card numbers and bank account information\nX\n\n\n\n\nMedical Information, such as health records and medical diagnoses\nX\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Information, such as DNA or RNA sequences\n\nX\n\n\n\nBiometric Information, such as fingerprints, facial recognition data, and iris scans\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n            All three Illinois Privacy laws protect personal information and financial information, but GIPA only covers genetic information while BIPA covers biometric information. It's worth noting that this table is not an exhaustive list of the types of data protected by these laws, but rather a high-level overview. Additionally, each law may have specific exceptions or limitations that impact the protection of certain types of data.\n            \n\nHow Do I Qualify?\n            If you received a letter from Face App notifying you that your personal information was impacted in their data breach, use the form below to find out if you may be eligible for significant compensation.\n            \n\n\nClaim Form Website: www.JoinClassActions.com\n\n\n\nSubmit Claim Here\n\n\n\nHow Do I Find Class Action Settlements?\nFind all the latest Class Action Settlements you can qualify for by getting notified of new lawsuits as soon as they are open to claims:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAttorney Advertising.

Consumers are reporting checks over $700.00 sent to their email with an option to select the type of payment. Yes, the Capital One open class action settlement payment emails are real, but be sure to check that the email is from the legitimate Capital One class action settlement administrator. As always, be careful sharing your  personally identifiable information online without checking sources first. \n            \n\n\n            The original capital one class action lawsuit was settled over the data breach and malicious hacking by third party actors of Capital One's consumer data. As a result a fund has been created to reimburse people affected by a recent Capital One\n            data breach in a record-breaking settlement. \n            \n\n            The Capital One data breach is massive affecting nearly 100 million consumers, and is similar to an ongoing class action that was settled with equifax over a data breach that resulted in personally identifiable information data leaks.\n            \n\n            In July 2019, Capital One announced that it had been the victim of a criminal\n            cyber attack on its systems. The cyber crime bad actor gained unauthorized access to the personal\n            information of approximately 98 million U.S. consumers.\n            \n\n            The information that have been\n            hacked included a combination of people's names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes,\n            phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, self-reported income, credit\n            scores, credit limits, balances, payment history, contact data, and/or fragments\n            of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n            \n\n            The Capital One data breach also resulted in about 120,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account\n            numbers being accessed by attackers. This data is deemed extremely sensitive as it is sensitive and personally identifiable information.\n            \n\nHow Do I Qualify?\n            The Capital One Data Breach Class Action is now closed to any new claims. To stay up to date on current and upcoming class actions join OpenClassAction.com's official newsletter, or stay up to date by bookmarking OpenClassAction's complete list of class action lawsuits currently open to claims.\n            \n\nHow Do I Find Class Action Settlements?\nFind all the latest Class Action Settlements you can qualify for by getting notified of new lawsuits as soon as they are open to claims:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat Can I Get?\n            Consumers are reporting payments upwards of $700 per class action claim form filed. For those that had proof that they had information compromised and their identities stole, payments are reported upwards of $10,000 per claim as of October 2023. Cash payment will be shared among all participant. Also in case you spent money\n            to deal with fraud or identity theft you can submit a claim for reimbursement (including your claim for Lost Time).\n            Out-of-Pocket Losses that are eligible for reimbursement may include, without\n            limitation, the following:\n            \n\n            • Money spent on or after March 22, 2019, associated with placing or removing a\n            security freeze on your credit report with any credit reporting agency;\n            \n\n            • Money spent on credit monitoring or identity theft protection on or after\n            March 22, 2019;\n            \n\n            • Non-reimbursed costs, expenses, losses or charges you paid on or after\n            March 22, 2019, because of identity theft or identity fraud, falsified tax\n            returns, or other alleged misuse of your personal information that you believe\n            was fairly traceable to the Data Breach;\n            \n\n            • Other miscellaneous expenses related to any Out-Of-Pocket Loss that you believe\n            were fairly traceable to the Data Breach such as notary, fax, postage, copying,\n            mileage, and long-distance telephone charges; and\n            \n\n            • Professional fees incurred in connection with addressing identity theft,\n            fraud, or falsified tax returns that you believe was fairly traceable to the\n            Data Breach.\n            \n\nHow Do I File a Claim?\n            You must have completed a claim form by September 30, 2022 online to qualify. The Capital One Data Breach Class Action Settlement is already paying out, and the class action has already passed the open class action period when files can be claimed, as well as the appeals phase. Many affected Capital One customers experienced a financial windfall far beyond their initial expectations. Some individuals claimed to have received payment notifications totaling upwards of $700.\n            \n\n\nClaim Form Website: CapitalOneSettlement.com\n\n\n\n                For more class actions keep scrolling below.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nTop New Data Breaches\n\n        Deadline: Pending\n    \nSubmit Claim\n\n\n\nMacy's® No Proof Class Action\n\n        Deadline: Open to Claims\n    \nSubmit Claim\n\n\n\nIGK Dry Shampoo Class Action Settlement\n\n        Deadline: 11/19/24\n    \nFile Claim\n\n\n\nVisa & Mastercard Settlement\n\n        Deadline: 08/30/24\n    \nSubmit Claim\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view and add Comments!\n\n\n\n\nNote: Class action claims are submitted under penalty of perjury - Do not submit fraudulent claims\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw Firms\nPrivacy Policy\nHome\nOCA © 2024.

            "Original": "I got a letter saying my son's personal and medical information had been exposed by Upstream. He has a LOT of medical issues so I'm constantly in contact with our insurance about meds and therapies but lately I have been getting calls, sometimes two or three a day from a number that says it's his insurance. They either want me to call them or someone will want me to confirm his identity to tell me \"important information about your health\". I am at least smart enough not to talk to them. I called our insurance and asked and they of course confirmed they'd never call like that and it would not be from any number but the one on the back of the card. \n\nYesterday I got a letter (or he did, as he's an adult but he's also autistic and I am his guardian) saying he was part of this breach.  I googled it and there are dozens of class action lawsuit sites wanting me to give THEM personal information to see if he qualifies to be part of the suit. I don't know if I should trust those sites or even be a part of a class action lawsuit. One question it asked is if I've had any hardships due to the breach. I think having someone call you multiple times a day is likely related to it, but how would that be proven? Should I sign up for a CAL or is it really worth it? I wouldn't expect compensation but it has been extremely frustrating because we've been waiting for a call from insurance about something really important so I hear the caller say it's his insurance and every time it's a kick in the gut because it's just another scammer.\n\nAnyway I imagine I've already written too much. I'm just so angry. I am so careful with our information but it doesn't matter when they can get it elsewhere and use it to exploit a person with special needs. If he didn't have me to handle his business there's no telling what information they could have gotten from him."

Each day, a staggering volume of data, totaling over 2.5 quintillion bytes, is produced, and this upward trend shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn this digital age, all organizations – big or small - are producing significant volumes of data (both structured and unstructured). While on one hand, the surge in data creation holds promise for businesses and consumers with regard to the discovery of valuable insights; on the other, attention has to be paid to the crucial aspect of data confidentiality - not only from a regulatory compliance standpoint but also from a business sustainability perspective.\nThe fundamental step to achieving data protection is the identification and classification of critical data. The other steps include,\nData labeling\nData loss prevention\nData masking\nData encryption\nThis blog is intended to give you a clear understanding of data classification and its role in data management and security.  We also touch upon different approaches and tools that help do this effectively.\n\n\n\nAn overview of data classification\n\n\nEffective data classification strategy\n\n\nThree main types of data classification\n\n\nInfoVision’s strategic approach to data classification\n\n\nTypical tools used in data classification\n\n\nInfoVision’s approach\n\n\n\nAn overview of data classification\nData classification is a crucial process that enables organizations to effectively manage their data. It involves categorizing data into different levels, such as public, private, and confidential. Additional security controls are implemented based on data classifications to enhance data protection further. These measures also assist in making better policy decisions based on different data categories.\nThe absence of data classification increases the risk of:\nData breaches\nNon-compliance with regulations\nLack of transparency\nIneffective incident response\nPoor data management\nEffective data classification strategy\n\n  \n\n\nThe classification mechanism simplifies data retrieval and location, which is essential for risk management, compliance, data security, and conforming to rules like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS compliance.\nThree main types of data classification\nData classification involves the use of multiple tags and labels that indicate the data's type, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The sensitivity level of the data is determined based on its importance and confidentiality, which in turn influences security strategies. The industry typically recognizes three primary types of data classification as the standard:\nContent-based\nAnalyzing the content of the data, such as the text in a document or the pixels in an image, to determine its classification. Content-based data classification is a powerful tool for data protection and management.\nContext-based\nThis approach considers the location, purpose, and use of the data. Context-based data classification can be useful for organizations that deal with large volumes of data with varying levels of sensitivity. It allows organizations to categorize data based on its intended use, making it easier to manage and protect the data.\nUser-based\nIt is valuable in organizations where data sensitivity varies significantly across different departments or individuals. Users may have a better awareness of changes in data sensitivity than a centralized data classification system, enabling them to promptly adjust the classification level as needed. Allowing users to classify data based on their unique knowledge ensures proper protection and management of sensitive data. However, user-based classification also presents challenges, such as potential inconsistency in classification and the risk of user error.\nInfoVision’s strategic approach to data classification\nEffective data classification is a key element of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy because it helps organizations identify the most valuable and sensitive data and apply appropriate security measures to protect it.\nInfoVision presents an excellent plan of action.  It empowers businesses to identify and implement the most sensitive and valuable security measures, ensuring robust data protection.\n\n  \n\n\nTypical tools used in data classification\nData classification technologies save administrative expenses, enhance digital data file maintenance, and reduce redundant data. Data classification was solely a user-driven procedure for a long time. Today, automation has emerged as a viable alternative.\nIn order to streamline data management, organizations can establish sophisticated systems that empower users to efficiently categorize the documents they produce, transmit, or modify, along with newly generated data. Additionally, users have the option to classify older materials, ensuring a systematic approach for comprehensive data organization; otherwise, they will be managed as uncategorized, potentially leading to inefficiencies in data handling.\nHere's a quick overview of some of the software solutions focused on data protection and classification:\nAIP (Azure Information Protection)\nThis technology component of the Microsoft Azure family of cloud-based services is used to secure data in both on-premise and cloud. The main advantage of the AIP tool is its easy interaction with other Microsoft applications, making it simple for users to categorize and protect their data within a familiar work environment.\nCipherTrust data discovery and classification tool\nIt helps businesses locate and manage sensitive data on-premise, in the cloud, as also in hybrid settings. With the help of this technology, companies can build and implement specific data classification policies, recognize or address security concerns as they arise, and monitor data in real time.\nTitus\nTitus aids in the identification and classification of sensitive data, the implementation of access control measures, and the prevention of data loss. Its integration with various security and information management systems (SIEM) helps the security team easily identify and respond to potential security issues.\nInfoVision’s approach\nIn the realm of modern businesses, a data classification policy stands as the cornerstone of robust security measures. Without a uniform framework to classify data, safeguarding sensitive information becomes an insurmountable task. After all, protecting data is contingent on acknowledging its existence, pinpointing its location, and determining the need for safeguarding.\nInfoVision provides a range of specialized services and solutions like data classification, data labeling, data loss prevention, data encryption, and data masking. By leveraging the latest technology and tools, InfoVision helps organizations stay ahead of the constantly evolving security threat landscape.\nFor any further queries or suggestions, write to us at  info.ecrs@infovision.com.\nTo ensure optimal security for your organization, learn more about an effective red-teaming strategy.

You can connect with them via the following contact details:\n\nCall 0800 073 8804\nContact us online.\nUse our live chat.\n\n\n\n\nSelect A Section\n\nWhat Is A Data Breach?\nWhen Could I Claim Data Breach Compensation?\nExamples Of Potential Data Breaches\nWhat Should I Do After A Data Breach?\nDoes The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) Pay Data Breach Compensation?\nWhat Evidence Do I Need To Support A Data Breach Claim?\nHow Much Compensation Could I Receive For A Personal Data Breach Claim?\nStart Your No Win No Fee Data Breach Claim Today\n\nTo see the key points from our guide, why not watch our video below:\n\nWhat Is A Data Breach?\nArticle 4 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) defines a personal data breach as a breach of security which leads to the unlawful or accidental disclosure, loss, alteration, destruction, or unauthorised access to someone’s personal data. \nPersonal data is any type of information that can reveal your identity. Some examples of personal data can include your email address, name, postal address, and national insurance number. \nSpecial category data is personal data that needs protecting more because the information is sensitive. Some examples of special category data can include your genetic data, biometric data, and data concerning your health. \nIf your personal data has been breached, contact us today to find out whether you can begin a personal data breach compensation claim. \nWhen Could I Claim Data Breach Compensation?\nIf your personal data was breached, you may wonder if you are entitled to compensation. The personal data of all UK residents is protected by the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA). \nData controllers, who decide how and why to use your personal data, and data processors, who process the data on behalf of the controller, are both expected to comply with these legislations. If they fail to do so, this is known as wrongful conduct.\nWrongful conduct can lead to a personal data breach. \nSo, in order to claim compensation for a data breach, you have to be able to prove that:\n\nA data breach occurred as a result of wrongful conduct\nYour personal data was affected by a data breach\nYou suffered mental or financial harm as a result\n\nWe look at a few data breach compensation examples further in this article, or you can speak with an advisor to discuss your eligibility to claim. \nExamples Of Potential Data Breaches\nYou could make a claim if your personal data was compromised in a data breach due to an organisation breaking the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA) and the UK General Data Protection Regulation’s (UK GDPR) rules. You will also need to prove that the personal data breach caused you to suffer mental harm or financial loss.\nThere are various ways an organisation’s failures could result in data protection breaches. Some examples include:\n\nHuman error, such as the receptionist at your GP surgery verbally sharing your medical records with an unauthorised person without a lawful basis.\nYour employer doesn’t update your workplace’s cyber security, which leads to a cyber-attack. The hacker then leaked your phone numbers (home and mobile), resulting in you receiving unwanted calls and messages.\nYour solicitor fails to lock away or secure a paper file containing your personal information. This could result in your personal data being lost or stolen.\nIn terms of real-life examples, Capita, a large data processing firm that administers pension funds for various organisations as well as data for the UK Government, experienced a major cybersecurity incident, including some of the biggest funds in the country. For more advice on the Capita data breach  head here. Another recent example came from the Southern Water also suffered a data breach in similar circumstances.\n\nIt is important to note that not all data breaches can lead to a claim. If you did not suffer any harm due to the data breach, or if the organisation took all the necessary steps and measurements to protect your personal data, but it was still compromised, you might not be able to claim.\nContact our advisors today to receive free legal advice regarding your specific claim. They could also help you answer any question you may have about starting a claim for a personal data breach.\n\n\n\nWhat Should I Do After A Data Breach?\nIf you suspect your personal data was compromised, you may want to know what to do after a data breach. Some steps you take could help secure your information, whilst others will help support a claim for data breach compensation.\nFirstly, you will want confirmation of the data breach. You could ask the organisation that you suspect breached your data to confirm that a data breach occurred, what data was included in it and how it happened. Any correspondence between yourself and the organisation can help support a compensation claim. We look at other examples of evidence later on.\nIf the organisation does not respond, or the response is unsatisfactory, you can complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). We further explain this in the next section.\nAdditionally, you could run a credit check. This could help alert you to any fraudulent activities, such as another party obtaining a credit card. You may also want to watch your bank statements to ensure criminals have not gained access to your account. Furthermore, you can notify your bank of the data breach.\nYou may also wish to take steps to protect your personal data, such as changing passwords on your online accounts, including those for email and social media.\nDirect any questions about what steps could help support a claim for data breach compensation to an advisor from our team.\nDoes The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) Pay Data Breach Compensation?\nThe ICO is an independent organisation that is charged with enforcing compliance with the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. They’re also charged with enforcing compliance with other laws, such as the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), as well as other legislation.\nThe ICO does not pay data breach compensation. \nIf you believe that you’ve fallen victim to a data breach, the ICO recommends contacting the organisation directly to complain.\nIf nothing comes of that complaint then you can take the matter up with the ICO, ideally no later than 3 months since you last heard from the organisation.\nAs we’ve seen above, the ICO can issue hefty fines, like the £20m they gave to British Airways. But above all, the ICO seeks to enforce compliance with the laws.\nThey provide recommendations and guidance on how organisations can fix problems with data protection.\nWhat Evidence Do I Need To Support A Data Breach Claim?\nIf you are eligible to make a claim for data breach compensation, collecting sufficient evidence could help support your case.\nSome examples of evidence that could help support your personal data breach claim include:\n\nConfirmation that your personal data was breached. For example, the organisation responsible may have sent you an email or letter stating that your personal data was involved in a data breach.\nAny communications with the data controller/processor responsible for the breach.\nIf you reported the breach to the ICO and they decided to investigate, the findings can be used as proof in your claim.\nProof that you suffered psychological harm due to the breach. For example, this could be a copy of your medical records stating that you were diagnosed with anxiety after the breach occurred.\nProof that you suffered financial losses due to the breach. A copy of your bank statements could be used as evidence for this.\n\nContact our advisors today to discuss your potential claim. If they believe you may have a strong case, they could connect you with a solcitor, who could help you with gathering evidence.\nHow Much Compensation Could I Receive For A Personal Data Breach Claim?\nIf your data breach claim is successful, you could be awarded compensation for your non-material damage and your material damage. You can claim for both damage independently or together. \nNon-material damage refers to how you have been affected mentally by a personal data breach. For example, you may experience anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other kinds of mental distress. \nWhen this head of data breach compensation is being valued, the Judicial College Guidelines (JCG) may be referred to. This document lists psychological injuries and illnesses alongside guideline settlement amounts. \nWe have taken some examples from the JCG in the table below (please note that the first figure is not from the JCG). These are just some examples of what you could suffer following a personal data breach. However, none of these amounts can be guaranteed for your GDPR claim as all data breach cases are unique. \n\n\n\nInjury TypeSeverityAmount\n\n\n\n\nSevere Psychological Harm With Financial LossesSeriousUp to £250,000+\n\n\nGeneral Psychiatric DamageSevere (a)£66,920 to £141,240 \n\n\nModerately Severe (b)£23,270 to £66,920\n\n\nModerate (c)£7,150 to £23,270\n\n\nLess Severe (d)£1,880 to £7,150 \n\n\nPost-Traumatic Stress DisorderSevere (a)£73,050 to £122,850\n\n\nModerately Severe (b)£28,250 to £73,050\n\n\nModerate (c)£9,980 to £28,250\n\n\nLess Severe (d)£4,820 to £9,980\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Damage\nMaterial damage refers to how you have been affected financially from a personal data breach. For example, if your credit card details are leaked, and this results in identity theft and fraudulent purchases made in your name, you could claim these losses back. \nTo learn more on how data breach compensation is calculated, please get in touch today.

That’s also when it caught the attention of an Atlanta-based prosecutor who is leading a separate investigation of Trump’s efforts to undo his loss in the state.\n\nSince then, revelations about what happened in the county of 43,000 people have raised questions about whether the Dominion Voting Systems machines used in Georgia have been compromised. \nThe public disclosure of the breach began with a rambling phone call from an Atlanta-area bail bondsman to the head of an election security advocacy group involved in a long-running lawsuit targeting the state’s voting machines.According to a recording filed in court earlier this year, the bail bondsman said he’d chartered a jet and was with a computer forensics team at the Coffee County elections office when they “imaged every hard drive of every piece of equipment.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat happened on Jan. 7, 2021, a day after the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and two days after a runoff election in which Democrats swept both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate seats.The trip to Coffee County, about 200 miles south of Atlanta, to copy data and software from elections equipment was directed by attorney Sidney Powell and other Trump allies, according to deposition testimony and documents produced in response to subpoenas.\n\nLater that month, security camera footage shows, two men who have participated in efforts to question the results of the 2020 election in several states spent days going in and out of the Coffee County elections office.The footage also shows local election and Republican Party officials welcoming the visitors and allowing them access to the election equipment. The video seems to contradict statements some of the officials made about their apparent involvement.The new information has made Coffee County, where Trump won nearly 70% of the vote two years ago, a focal point of concerns over the security of voting machines. While there is no evidence of widespread problems with voting equipment in 2020, some Trump supporters have spread false information about machines and the election outcome.Election security experts and activists fear state election officials haven’t acted fast enough in the face of what they see as a real threat.The copying of the software and its availability for download means potential bad actors could build exact copies of the Dominion system to test different types of attacks, said University of California, Berkeley computer scientist Philip Stark, an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the voting machines lawsuit.\n\n“This is like bank robbers having an exact replica of the vault that they’re trying to break into,” he said.Stark said the risks could be minimized by using hand-marked paper ballots and rigorous audits. Dominion says its equipment remains secure.Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, the group that sued over the state’s voting machines, said the state has been slow to investigate. She was on the receiving end of the phone call from the bail bondsman.The state, she said, has been “repeatedly looking the other way when faced with flashing red lights of serious voting system security problems.”State officials say they’re confident the election system is safe. All Coffee County election equipment that wasn’t already replaced will be swapped out before early voting begins next month, the secretary of state’s office said Friday.\n\nState officials also noted they were deluged by false claims after the 2020 election.“In retrospect, you can say, well what about this, this and this,” said Gabriel Sterling, a top official in the Georgia secretary of state’s office. “In real time, no, there was no reason to think that.”In late January 2021, a few weeks after the computer forensics team visited, security video shows a secretary of state’s office investigator arriving at the Coffee County elections office. He and the elections supervisor walk into the room that houses the election management system server. Seconds later, Jeff Lenberg, who has been identified by Michigan authorities as being part of an effort to gain access to voting machines there, is seen walking out of that room.\n\nAsked whether Lenberg’s presence in the room with sensitive election equipment raised concerns for the investigator, secretary of state’s office spokesperson Mike Hassinger said the investigator was looking into an unrelated matter and didn’t know who Lenberg was.Security video also showed another man, Doug Logan, at the office in mid-January. Logan founded a company called Cyber Ninjas, which led a discredited review of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona. In May 2021, Coffee County’s new elections supervisor raised concerns with the secretary of state’s office after finding Logan’s business card by a computer. The election supervisor’s concerns were referred to an investigator, but he testified that no one ever contacted him.Hassinger said the secretary of state’s office responds to allegations when they are raised but that “information about unauthorized access to Coffee County’s election equipment has been kept hidden” by local officials and others.Much of what is known was uncovered through documents, security camera video and depositions produced in response to subpoenas in the lawsuit filed by individual voters and the election security advocacy group. The suit alleges Georgia’s touchscreen voting machines are not secure and seeks to force the state to use hand-marked paper ballots instead.The recently produced evidence of a breach wasn’t the first sign of problems in Coffee County, which caused headaches for state election officials in the hectic weeks following the 2020 election. It’s likely that turmoil helped open the door for Trump’s allies.In early December 2020, the county elections board declined to certify the results of a machine recount requested by Trump, saying the election system had produced inaccurate results. A video posted online days later showed the former county elections supervisor saying the elections software could be manipulated; as she spoke, the password to the county election management system server was visible on a note stuck to her computer.At the end of December, Cathy Latham, the Coffee County Republican Party chair who also was a fake elector for Trump, appeared at a state legislative committee hearing and made further claims that the voting machines were unreliable.Within days of that hearing, Latham said, she was contacted by Scott Hall, the bail bondsman, who had been a Republican observer during an election recount. Latham testified in a deposition that Hall asked her to connect him with the Coffee County elections supervisor (who later was accused of falsifying timesheets and forced to resign).A few days later, on Jan. 7, Hall met with a computer forensics team from data solutions firm SullivanStrickler at the Coffee County elections office. The team copied the data and software on the election management system server and other voting system components, a company executive said in a deposition. The company said it believed its clients had the necessary permission.Invoices show the data firm billed Powell $26,000 for the day’s work.“Everything went smoothly yesterday with the Coffee County collection,” the firm’s chief operating officer wrote to Powell in an email. “Everyone involved was extremely helpful.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

            "Original": "The New Threat to our Justice System | by El Dawton | MediumOpen in appSign upSign inWriteSign upSign inThe New Threat to our Justice SystemEl Dawton·Follow4 min read·Aug 2, 2022--ListenShareCybersecurity within the justice system is an incredibly important consideration but, bizarrely, not one that gets much attention. The processes, individual actors and organisations (including the sheer number of steps from arrest, processing, CPS decision, trial, sentencing, rehabilitation and re-entry) involved make it ripe for attack at several sensitive junctures.Lately, I’ve been reading up on cybersecurity, after a story broke last year about HMPPS (Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service) and just how many data breaches it’s had. Via a FOI request, CEL Solicitors received confirmation from HMPPS that between September 2020 and September 2021, there were 2,152 data breaches, with one being serious enough to report to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). And that’s just one organisation in the justice sector.In our field, the safety of the sensitive information collected and passed around during the legal process is paramount, and it’s vital to raise awareness of this issue. 95% of all data breaches (this includes ransomware, spyware, hacking, phishing, et al) are caused by human error (according to data from most governments, including the UK government). It’s paramount that we begin teaching these organisations (whether it’s the police, the courts or individual law firms) how important the security aspect of carrying out justice truly is. So much sensitive data is held during the criminal justice process from police investigations to finding and charging a suspect and throughout the trial process and incarceration, and of course, the most important part — re-entering society, having paid their dues and ‘served’ their time to begin being a fully functioning, beneficial member of society again.With so many vulnerable members of our society going through the system, we desperately need to ramp up our security, encryption and cyber hygiene. Lest you think there aren’t vulnerable people in the system, by the way, remember that 10% of people in UK prisons are mentally ill people with severely reduced mental capacity — people who, according to the Royal Society of Psychiatrists’ 2021 report on the subject, would be far better served with appropriate medical care than by being locked up. Furthermore, former Armed Services personnel make up 3% of those in UK prisons — people who, because of the PTSD induced by fighting in Britain’s wars, end up unfortunately falling out of society and into drug abuse and often, crime. So it really is vital to protect these vulnerable people, as well as the witnesses and suspects headed for trial.How to prevent data breaches in the criminal justice systemThe first step is to make sure that everyone involved at any point during the process — yes, even magistrates’ courts — is au fait with cybersecurity best practices and how to avoid falling for social engineering scams (the biggest proportion of that aforementioned 95% of data breaches — you can read all about how to avoid those scams here).The second step in boosting cybersecurity for the justice system is to get the right software and tools in place to keep all your data (including past data and cloud and on-site storage) safe — and thus, keep people safe.One of the other things to keep in mind, particularly when choosing the right digital tools to protect your employees and those we serve, is that most major companies around the world, as well as many governments, are taking the upcoming threat of quantum computers seriously. With the Chinese, American and British governments developing quantum computers as well as Google, Microsoft and IBM, it’s only a matter of time before they’re powerful enough, warns the US government, that they’ll be able to bash through all our current methods of encryption and protection.The way around this, of course, is to either have a multi-layered security approach, or engage an all-rounder — with the second probably being the most cost-effective and easiest.One British company, Arqit Quantum, has actually come up with a solution to both our current encryption problems and the advent of the quantum computer security issue. They have a plug-and-play cloud-based software called QuantumCloud, which works with current infrastructure and is designed to protect your data from any future quantum threat we may face. And more importantly, it was developed by encrypters and computing geniuses who used to work at GCHQ — meaning it’s already fit for purpose for government bodies such as the Ministry of Justice, the courts, and Her Majesty’s Prison Service.You might not be in the market for new security software or a costly training programme for your employees in order to avoid social engineering scams, but the cost is just too dreadful to consider otherwise, and will put lives at risk. Here are just two reasons that have me worried:Safety of suspects — if people found out who a suspect was before police had a chance to put them under surveillance or arrest them, vigilantes would be able to jump in and pervert the course of justice, harm someone who hadn’t been given a fair trial or been proven guilty.Safety of witnesses in state protection — there are people who have been safe for a long period of time, adjusting to their new lives, who have helped put dangerous criminals away. Imagine the worry they’d face knowing the police had lax security.If, God forbid, it was you in either scenario, would you feel safe without the very best cybersecurity keeping your information private? Despite the rising number and variety of cyber attacks, not all businesses or organisations in the sector have made moves to strengthen their cyber defences. Some still use outdated IT systems, but it’s important that they adapt and stay one step ahead, or all our secrets could be left exposed.CybersecurityQuantum ComputingData BreachLegalJustice System----FollowWritten by El Dawton19 FollowersFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Content in this post may reflect the words and intentions of the threat actor, not Backchannel. For archival sake, and lack of exogenous sources, this post will provide links to RaidForums posts. It is not recommended that you visit unless you are familiar with the terrain.Since October 2021, a user going by “AgainstTheWest” (ATW) has published various data breaches and evidence of website defacements on the underground forum RaidForums. While RaidForums is not particularly known for housing high-tier, persistent threat actors, ATW has proven to be engaged in a weeks-long campaign against the People’s Republic of China, through cyberattacks targeting government and corporate entities tied to the Chinese Communist Party.In this post, we’ll walk through a loose profile of ATW, looking into their motivations and characteristics, and then provide a timeline of ATW’s operations.AgainstTheWest’s profile on Raidforums.AgainstTheWest uses imagery from the movie/TV series Max Headroom for their online presence on RF and Keybase. An estimated timeline of operations is provided in our analysis notebook linked here.Long time listener, first time callerATW first appeared in on October 14, in a post to RaidForum’s Leaks Market section where they claimed to be putting up for sale hacked materials stolen from the Chinese central bank: “we have been working for at least two months on this operation. It has allowed us to gain access to the People's Bank Of China internal assets.”Like their profile picture of Max Headroom might suggest, there is sarcasm and trolling in ATW’s persona. “This is a virus. Reported,” they reply to someone’s idea of good music1. Ultimately, the impression given is that ATW knows how to use the forum; they know how sales work, they know the moderators and can intimate some knowledge of the forum’s history, and they talk like the locals. It is not likely that the October 14 account creation date was the user’s first visit to the site.“Today I managed to deadlift 150kg / 330lb at my local gym. Pretty happy with myself :-)” ATW posts in a thread they created to discuss weightlifting, mere hours after disclosing alleged breaches of Alipay, a Chinese defense contractor, and civilian PII2. It’s almost as if ATW is right at home.Not motivated by moneyThough some of ATW’s earlier posts were put up for sale, many since then have been given away for free. “If this never sells, we'll probably just end up putting it up for free. Not really bothered by money,” they say in a reply to a thread of their breached Alibaba Cloud data3. This point is perhaps further demonstrated by their acceptance of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be trivially tracked, rather than the underground’s preferred currency, Monero. Ultimately, RaidForums does not usually have the reputation for a location where big deals for data or warez go down, as there are more serious and reliable forums for that.“It would seem that we've pissed off China, finally”Despite dabbling in targets that follow some sort of topical agenda4, for ATW it’s really all about China. Usually pointing to the Uighur genocide or aggression towards Taiwan, ATW claims that their motivations are in direct response to some sort of action conducted by the Chinese government.We've noticed that China still refuses to back down from intimidating Taiwan. We'll continue to leak their shit until they stop.It’s not clear that this feedback loop has yet to work in ATW’s favor. In fact, if media attention is one of the goals of ATW’s operations, they seem to publicly lament the lack of it: “Most of my shit still isn't being reported on,” they say in a Discord channel. “Guess China is really that spooky.”So far the biggest piece in the public sphere on ATW is from Chinese cybersecurity firm Sangfor who took to the media site Sohu to write a technical report ATW’s breach of the People’s Bank of China5. In the analysis, Sangfor describes how Sonarqube servers were accessed due to older versions of the software allowing public access by default. This particular technique targeting this software fits the profile of some recent hacktivist activity; the FBI published a flash notification due to hacktivists targeting this software just last year6.“It would seem that we've pissed off China, finally,” ATW comments in response to the Sangfor piece, criticizing it for several inaccuracies that were published.AgainstTheWest’s Posting BehaviorIn an analysis of about 300 ATW posts, we can attempt to understand the sort of “working schedule” that ATW has by basing all activity on the same 24-hour axis. AgainstTheWest’s posts occur on a schedule with peaks between 0300-0600 hours, 1100-1700 hours, and 1700 hours to 18500 hours, all UTC.When removing thread creation from this dataset, you strictly get the volume of replies that ATW has made. This is useful in the scenario where ATW might be scheduling or automating thread creation.Further precision to the 24-hour scale when a selection is made on replies only.However, this may not be telling us the full picture. What if ATW’s schedule changed, either as a result of changing timezones, multiple operators, or an intentional decision to conform to a different schedule? One way to determine that is to extrapolate the 24-hour activity chart for each week of ATW’s operation on the forum.24-hour normalized chart for posts, grouped by 2 week increments. Volume and consistency trended upward as the operations continue.A word bubble generated off of the posts to the forum may shed a little light on the language diversity used by ATW. It is not surprising that much of the language centers around the stated mission of ATW.Fuzzy word cloud derived from AgainstTheWest’s posts. See the Observable notebook here: observablehq.com/@backchannel/againstthewest-weekly-activityWhen removing the highly concentrated language, we may gain some additional insight into ATW’s writing patterns.Fuzzy word cloud of filtered down post content derived from AgainstTheWest’s posts. See the Observable notebook here: observablehq.com/@backchannel/againstthewest-weekly-activityAuthenticity and final thoughtsThe straightforward nature of AgainstTheWest’s mission and operations perhaps lend credibility to the idea that they are who they say they are: an everyday RaidForums user with some nominal hacking skills and an ideological opposition to the Chinese Communist Party’s activities. Cybersecurity professionals may be quick to consider that some degree of deception is at play when a group who emerges from thin air, with varying degrees of credibility and the claimed mission of “hacktvism.” Many high-profile cases where hacktivism is referenced often end up being a cover for nation-state actors executing information operations 7 8.But with AgainstTheWest, there is maybe a hint of authenticity. Between the lack of sophistication in their attack chain, or their transparent comfortability with RaidForums, ATW has some dimensions not consistent with the nation-targeting operations we know of. “It’s interesting because we in the United States often never hear this side of it,” says Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade9, a Principal Security Researcher at SentinelOne. “You typically hear of cyberoperations targeting us.” In November, Guerrero-Saade gave a talk at CyberWarCon about the use of hacktivism as a cover for nation-state information operations 10. One trend between the operations featured in the talk were that they usually had a single objective, little work going beyond that scope. “One thing about this profile is that they’re leaned into the hacktivist aesthetic, coming up with targets as they go,” says Guerrero-Saade. “Keeping up with that persona would take work.”The unique profile of AgainstTheWest makes it worth keeping up with, where we may learn more about their motivations or background. We will continue to watch AgainstTheWest as they continue their operations.An estimated timeline of operations is provided in our analysis notebook linked here.1 https://raidforums.com/Thread-OJ-X-TR-Back2Back?pid=4611207#pid46112072 https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII3 https://raidforums.com/Thread-SELLING-Chinese-Alibaba-Cloud-Aliyun-ALL-PLATFORM-SRCs-Frontend-Backend-2021-ATW?pid=4603507#pid46035074 Threads with alleged breaches from Poland and Russia both followed newsdays where either country was in the news for some sort of hawkish activity.5https://www.sohu.com/a/502400487_244641?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui,sc6https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20399900-fbi_flash_sonarqube_access_bc7Perhaps most famous is Gufficer 2.0, a persona maintained by Russian Intelligence Services.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guccifer_2.08Far more comedic (and my personal favorite) is the Guardians of Peace. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack9https://twitter.com/juanandres_gs10https://www.cyberwarcon.com/last-cover-for-action1Share this postAgainstTheWest, the hacking group wreaking havoc on Chinese government and corporate targetsbackchannel.substack.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherShareTopLatestNo postsReady for more?Subscribe© 2024 Backchannel, Inc.Privacy ∙ Terms ∙ Collection notice Start WritingGet the appSubstack is the home for great cultureShareCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        This site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

The company said it learned of a “disruption” to its systems on September 15 and moved to “immediately secure” its environment. By October 4, the company said it had determined cybercriminals had infiltrated its systems and gained access to certain files, including employee names and SSNs.\n\n\n\nWhile CPK didn’t confirm how many people are impacted by the breach, a notification from the Maine attorney general’s office reported a total of 103,767 current and former employees — including eight Maine residents — are affected. CPK employed around 14,000 people as of 2017, suggesting the bulk of those affected are former employees. (TechCrunch contacted CPK for more but did not immediately hear back.)\n“Information security is among our highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care,” CPK added. “Upon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to review and reinforce the security of our computing environment. We are reviewing existing security policies and have implemented additional measures to further protect against similar incidents moving forward.”\nHowever, while CPK is shoring up its security in light of the incident, it’s unclear why it took the company two months to notify state authorities of the intrusion. The company said its data breach notification “has not been delayed by law enforcement.”\nHow to decode a data breach notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nMore TechCrunch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the industry’s biggest tech news\nExplore all newsletters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch Daily News\nEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nStartups Weekly\nStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch Fintech\nThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechCrunch Mobility\nTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail address (required)\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\ncomputer security, computing, cryptography, data breach, data security, law enforcement, maine, Safety, Security, security, security breaches, United States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tTransportation\t\nHow CNH’s ‘black belt’ M&A head makes deals\n\n\n\nSean O'Kane\n\n\n\n\n\t1 hour ago\n\n\nHeavy equipment manufacturer CNH Industrial has a long history of mergers and acquisitions, at times supervising legendary brands like Ferrari.

Nearly every Russian region now requires the passes in order to access public areas and events amid a record-breaking fourth wave of the pandemic.\nThe issue gained further urgency as lawmakers announced plans Thursday to mandate the QR codes nationwide and the Kremlin warned that these and other restrictions will only be lifted after the end of the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n\nnews\n\n\n\t\t\t\tRussia Imposes Digital Covid Passes Amid Virus Surge\t\t\t\nRead more\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Kommersant, the names, phone numbers and addresses of 500,000 fake QR code buyers from the Moscow region appeared on the encrypted Telegram messaging app. The data can reportedly be purchased for up to 40 rubles ($0.55) per person.\nIT experts told the publication they believe the QR code sellers themselves may have leaked the data to blackmail the buyers into paying for their removal from the database.\n“Given that the use of fake QR codes has been proposed to become criminally punishable, this could turn into a new gold mine for fraudsters,” said Ashot Oganesyan, founder of the Data Leakage & Breach Intelligence service that tracks online leaks.\n“It’s no surprise that scammers are trying to make money by selling their customers’ data,” Oganesyan was quoted as saying.\nThose found guilty of buying a fake QR code risk going to jail for up to one year in Russia. Those implicated in making and selling the fake certificates face up to two years in prison.\n“It’s naive to believe that the hackers will be attentive to your personal data if you sought illegal services,” Alexander Dvoryansky, head of strategic communications at the Infosecurity threat detection service, told Kommersant.\nNews of the data breach follows widespread reports that Russian lawmakers plan to legally require QR codes, a scannable barcode system, to enter stores, cafes and public transportation.\nThe Kremlin said Thursday that authorities will lift QR code requirements and other curbs imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19 once the pandemic ends.\nRussian public health officials forecast this week that the country would come out of the pandemic by 2022, with stubbornly low vaccination levels wrecking the Kremlin’s initial target of reaching herd immunity this year. \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more about:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tCoronavirus\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t,  \n\tVaccine\n\n\n\n\nA Message from The Moscow Times:\nDear readers,\nWe are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an \"undesirable\" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a \"foreign agent.\"\nThese actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work \"discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership.\" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.\nWe, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.\nYour support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.\nBy supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression.

(Darrell Roberts/CBC - image credit)Darrell Roberts/CBCOfficials have confirmed that personal information of medical patients in Newfoundland and Labrador has been stolen in the cyberattack that has wreaked havoc on the provincial health-care system for over two weeks.While speaking with reporters on Monday, Justice Minister John Hogan said it was his understanding that both patient and employee data have been taken in the attack.The news follows Friday's update, where he said that employee data had been taken, but said the investigation had not yet determined if patient data had also been stolen. A spokesperson clarified that the situation changed following the Friday update, and the investigation was able to confirm that patient data had been stolen.The stolen patient information includes names, addresses, Medical Care Plan (MCP) numbers, who the patient was visiting, the reason for the visit, name of doctor, phone numbers, birthdays, email addresses, in- and out-patient status, maiden name and marital status.Hogan said the regional health authorities are responsible for the data, but that government has a responsibility to keep the public up to date on the evolving situation.\"We have a responsibility as well, as the government, to advise the public about any safety concerns,\" Hogan said.Hogan said the government can not yet inform individuals if their data has been taken because it is part of the ongoing investigation.Officials first said that patient and employee data had been stolen on Tuesday, before backtracking on Wednesday, saying the data had been \"accessed,\" but the investigation could not confirm if data had been taken.Hogan said there is no current evidence that the stolen data has been misused, but didn't rule out the possibility either.Health Minister John Haggie said there is a \"significant possibility\" that data has been stolen from three regional health authorities: Eastern Health, Central Health and Labrador-Grenfell Health. Officials said last week that Western Health data has not been accessed.Employee data from within the three affected health authorities may have also been taken during the breach, officials said last week.That data includes names, addresses, contact information and social insurance numbers. Last week, Haggie said there is no evidence that banking information was stolen.While Eastern Health confirmed on Friday that patient data had been stolen, Central Health and Labrador-Grenfell Health have not yet said the same. CBC News has asked for comment.Government unsure when it can reveal cyberattack detailsAlthough officials have now confirmed that both employee and patient data have been stolen, they would not reveal other details about the investigation, or even say if the stolen data was encrypted.\"We're following the recommendations of our experts as to what to say and what not to say,\" said Haggie.During question period in the House of Assembly on Monday, both Opposition Leader David Brazil and NDP Leader Jim Dinn both called for more transparency in the investigation, asking the government to commit to an inquiry into the cyberattack.Government declined to commit to an inquiry, citing the current investigation in progress.\"We need to be very careful about what tool we're selecting, and the appropriate instrument needs to be employed,\" Premier Andrew Furey told reporters after the session.Brazil said he understands that certain sensitive information can't be shared yet, but he wants the government to commit to an eventual inquiry in order to find out what went wrong.\"We need to ensure this never happens again,\" he said.Mark Quinn/CBCThe RCMP and Information and Privacy Commissioner Michael Harvey have already announced their own respective investigations into the cyberattack, but Brazil said an inquiry would allow for more public accountability.\"A public inquiry gives the ability then to bring in witnesses, the experts, those who are directly affected by this. All the key stakeholders that have been involved in the process here,\" he said.Dinn questioned if government hesitated to commit to an inquiry because they have something to hide.\"There are some serious questions that need to be asked as to what led up to it,\" he said. \"How do we make sure that it becomes more difficult for it to happen again?\"Furey said the government doesn't know when it will be able to share more about the attack.\"The reality is that we don't know exactly when we'll be able to disclose everything that everybody wants to hear,\" he said.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorUp nextUp nextUp nextUp nextLatest StoriesThe Daily BeastTrump’s Anger Out of Control as Poll Numbers Keep CrateringDonald Trump’s advisers are getting increasingly anxious about his flailing public appearances since the attempt on his life and Democrats’ presidential candidate switcheroo—all while knowing he’s unlikely to change.

Exposed data includes email addresses, usernames, and IP addresses, among other info, seemingly about the site’s users and models.I alerted Stripchat on November 5, 2021 in accordance with our responsible disclosure policy. The database was secured two days later.The exposure could pose a significant privacy risk for both Stripchat viewers and models. If the data was stolen, they could face harassment, humiliation, stalking, extortion, phishing, and other threats both online and offline.Our usual process is to contact the affected party so that they can investigate the incident and take appropriate action including informing affected users.We reached out to Stripchat multiple times via email and Twitter but Stripchat has not responded nor acknowledged our disclosure or requests for comment at time of publishing.Timeline of the exposureThe database was accessible on the internet without a password or any other authentication required. Here’s what we know happened:November 4, 2021 – The database was indexed by search engines.November 5, 2021 – Diachenko discovered the database, determined the owner, and sent an alert to Stripchat per our responsible disclosure policy.November 7, 2021 – The database was no longer available.We do not know how long the database was exposed for prior to being indexed by search engines. Our honeypot experiments show that attackers can find and access unprotected databases in a matter of hours.What information was exposed?The Elasticsearch cluster contained about 200 million records in total, comprised of several databases:A user database containing circa 65 million records, each with some or all of the following info:Email addressUsernameIP addressInternet service providerTip balanceTimestamp of account creationTimestamp of last activityBlocked statusA model database of about 421,000 records, each with some or all of the following info:UsernameGenderStudio IDLive statusTip menus and pricesStrip scoreA transaction database of circa 134 million records with information about tokens and tips paid by users to models, including private tips.A moderation database of about 719,000 chat messages sent to models, including both private and public messages. Each record contains the user ID of the viewer who sent the message.Dangers of exposed dataThe exposure could be a digital and physical threat for both Stripchat viewers and models. IP addresses, which can be used to approximate someone’s location, are particularly worrying. They could enable someone to find and stalk, harass, or even assault someone in the database.Aside from physical violence, the identifying information could be used to extort, bully, or humiliate victims who thought their online activities were private.Lastly, victims should be on the lookout for targeted phishing emails from fraudsters posing as Stripchat or a related company. Never click on links or attachments in unsolicited emails.About StripchatStripchat is an adults-only website featuring live webcam performances, usually of nudity or sexual activity. The company was founded in 2016 and is incorporated in Cyprus.A company blog post notes Stripchat saw a 72 percent increase in traffc in 2020 following the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, including more than 900 million new users and 300,000 new models.Users don’t need to register an account to view public cams, but an account is required to tip, chat, or make a session private.Why we reported this incidentWe regularly search the web for unsecured database containing personally identifiable user information. When we find an unprotected server, we immediately begin an investigation to find out to whom it belongs, who could be affected, and potential consequences for end users.After verifying the identity of the responsible party, we alert them according to our responsible disclosure policy.

We’ve determined that several thousand entries in the list contain phone numbers, and the list also contains other text entries that we’re continuing to analyze. We continue to believe that the list did not contain Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers and that there has been no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident. We’ll continue making appropriate disclosures to affected people.\n\n\n\n\nNovember 8, 2021\nLate in the evening of November 3, we experienced a data security incident. An unauthorized third party obtained access to a limited amount of personal information for a portion of our customers. Based on our investigation, the attack has been contained and we believe that no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, or debit card numbers were exposed and that there has been no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident. \nThe unauthorized party socially engineered a customer support employee by phone and obtained access to certain customer support systems. At this time, we understand that the unauthorized party obtained a list of email addresses for approximately five million people, and full names for a different group of approximately two million people. We also believe that for a more limited number of people—approximately 310 in total—additional personal information, including name, date of birth, and zip code, was exposed, with a subset of approximately 10 customers having more extensive account details revealed. We are in the process of making appropriate disclosures to affected people.\nAfter we contained the intrusion, the unauthorized party demanded an extortion payment. We promptly informed law enforcement and are continuing to investigate the incident with the help of Mandiant, a leading outside security firm. \n“As a Safety First company, we owe it to our customers to be transparent and act with integrity,” said Robinhood Chief Security Officer Caleb Sima. “Following a diligent review, putting the entire Robinhood community on notice of this incident now is the right thing to do.” \nIf you are a customer looking for information on how to keep your account secure, please visit Help Center > My Account & Login > Account Security. When in doubt, log in to view messages from Robinhood—we’ll never include a link to access your account in a security alert. \n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis blog post contains forward-looking statements regarding Robinhood Markets, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“we,” “Robinhood,” or the “Company”) including our efforts to investigate and remediate the data security incident and our attempts to identify and provide appropriate disclosures to affected customers, among others. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this blog post. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others, our ongoing investigation of the incident; our vulnerability to additional data security incidents; adverse legal, reputational and financial effects on the Company resulting from the incident or additional data security incidents; and potential operational disruptions as a result of the incident. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.

Like an app that is made available in the kiosk mode, tap it and the script is run.\n\n(The script will blacklist all SSIDs (accept 1), remove the saved information of those SSIDs and connect to 1 specific SSID.)\n\nIf that's not possible, is there a possibility to run the script every hour on the device? I saw that you can schedule tasks, but those are initiated from Soti and not from the device itself? (basically, I want a scheduled task in Windows)\n\nThanks in advance!"

I have spent days to troubleshoot but could not get anywhere. So now raising this discussion to get some help understanding what is happening here as I have hit the wall and cannot find any helpful information on internet.\n\n**1 - Event Viewer showing AAD token broker errors**\n\nThese errors presenting issue with AAD token not being able to return. Also, all the client ID mentioned in these alerts are for Microsoft managed application like:- Edge, Teams, OneDrive.\n\n  \n[https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/0d11cea1-731a-4fdb-9659-82e8f8313c4c?platform=QnA](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/0d11cea1-731a-4fdb-9659-82e8f8313c4c?platform=QnA)\n\nHowever, I have checked and we are not experiencing any authentication issues with Microsoft managed apps hence not sure why event viewer is complaining.\n\nTo give you the summary of our company setup. We are using Configuration manager with Intune and we are hybrid joined.\n\n**2 - Software center unable to check device compliance.**\n\nWe have Software center deployed to manage application request and for device compliance check.\n\nAfter discovering these errors I have tested few things:\n\n1. No issues when re-imaging device. Device can join company and shows in AAD and Intune\n2. No issues adding new device to company\n3. Can still deploy app and user can install them\n4. **ONLY ISSUE we have is Software center cannot check the device compliance anymore and throwing below error.** \n\n[https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/9676077b-9945-4635-9b25-b590e9340372?platform=QnA](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/9676077b-9945-4635-9b25-b590e9340372?platform=QnA)\n\nWhen checking device compliance from Configuration manager and Intune, device is showing compliant which is why its getting more difficult to troubleshoot as why Software Center is failing for compliance check.\n\nI have checked Software center logs from CCM folder and it shows below error for unable to get jwToken:\n\n[https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/96b9470f-522c-42d6-9075-2b651594a824?platform=QnA](https://learn-attachment.microsoft.com/api/attachments/96b9470f-522c-42d6-9075-2b651594a824?platform=QnA)\n\nAny further help or directions will be appreciated.\n\nThanks"

            "Original": "Hi All\n\nWe're a small internal IT team at a larger orgnisation. As part of this we're looking to oursource our SIEM/SOC/SOAR to a provider that can manage this and provide that level of security monitoring that we're unable to do in-house.\n\nWe took our needs analysis around functionality and had a consultant help review products and we came back to either Crowdsrike Next-Gen SIEM or a managed FortiSIEM solution.\n\nThis is where I'm a bit stuck. We're currently using CS Falcon Complete, but also use Fortigate for our Firewalls and eventually our endpoint VPN's. If we move to a partner for our solution, we would be removing Falcon Complete and just licence the endpoint protect, with the partner taking care of the alerts.\n\nOut options are:\n\n* Crowdstrike MDR + Falcon Complete + Identity + Spotlight + FileVantage\n* Managed FortiSIEM with SOC/SOAR with a global company, but their Austrlian arm runs their SOC locally, 24/7 eyes on glass\n\nCrowdstrike is about 70% of the price of the traditional SOC option, but I'm just not 100% sure if what they are offering are of the same level and not sure how to accuratly see what is missing. For us, one of the most important things is to have almost \"zero-touch\" of the solution, but still having access to our data, should we want to investigate other issues. We want something where things are automatically handled and resolved, without relying on our team to be watching dashboards all day long.\n\nWe would like to feed in data such as our firewalls, event logs from windows and our O365 logs as a minimum\n\nThe traditional option also gives us access to security consultants for any other work (costed seperately) and a few other non-tangable things.\n\nHas anyone ever looked at the two options and come up with a prefrence? (Lets also just ignore the CS outage as I believe it would still have bitten us if we used their endpoint protect)\n\nS"

            "Original": "A few months ago our company implemented Verizon MDM to manage people's work iPhones in the field. I'm not sure how it happened but there are a bunch of phones on our MDM system that do not belong to our company. And it just seems like random people's phone in random states. I am assuming it is because some phones were returned by our company but they were not properly wiped and they were refurbished and sold. So the issue we were having is that, we have admin control over completely random strangers phones. Obviously we want to get these people off of our system but it would require wiping their device and then removing the Apple business manager license so their phone won't show up in our Verizon MDM anymore. What would be the best way of going about this? Obviously if you see a message or notification by a random company you never heard about telling you to wipe your phone you would probably ignore it. \n\nWhat I did for now was just send a text message to those phone numbers that show up in our MDM system to give them a one week notice. Our receptionist did call some of the numbers to let the person their phone was on our system, so they should be aware enough about the issue and should backup their data. And some phones don't even have phone numbers attached in the system or are glitched, it is just blank or too many digits, so we have no way of contacting them but can tell that one someone is using the phone by the apps installed. Is this fair to just wipe the phones remotely?"

I started in the MSP space, where I gained most of my on-prem and some 365 cloud experience. My roles have ranged from answering phones and handling tickets to having full autonomy in coordinating infrastructure and major software upgrades. I’ve maintained servers and designed solutions for small companies.\n\n\n\nHowever, I feel that many of my skills are “old school” on-premise skills.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I’m back in an office setting, supporting Hyper-V servers, workstations, and performing basic 365 tasks like managing users (add, edit, delete). We don’t use any of the more advanced 365 or Azure features—just basic Teams, SharePoint, and Exchange Online.\n\n\n\nI’m looking to get some certifications that will help with my day-to-day tasks and maybe teach me some new tricks, even though we’re not using the more advanced 365 features. I also want to use these certs to position myself for higher pay and new opportunities. I’ve been with my current company for 6 years, and I feel I’ve maxed out in terms of what I can do here.\n\n\n\nI’m considering some intermediate/expert 365 certifications, particularly those focused on security and endpoint management. After that, I might pursue another cert to make myself more competitive for an upper-level analyst role or an IT manager/assistant manager position.\n\nI am concerned that whatever cert that I get, that I won't be able to use all the skills that I learned at my current company. That means I can't state on my resume that I am using my cert to the fullest and I am at the same level as a fresh grad.\n\nMy current pay is $80K CAD gross, thanks to inflation adjustments and a slight market adjustment after I mentioned to my manager that I was exploring other opportunities.  Supposedly, if I stick around longer and after our manager retires, I will have the ass manager role butI think I will be waiting around for another 6-7 years.  Also, I’m in my 40s, so I’m not exactly a spring chicken.\n\n\n\nWhat should I do next?\n\n  \nThanks,"

Everything installed good and everything works. But boy is NetWare's GUI slow! \n\nFor that reason, I wanted to administer the server via the web consoles provided by  the OS (iManager, Remote Manager.etc) Only issue is when I go and to these web sites on Chrome on my host machine, it gives me the \"ERR\\_SSL\\_VERSION\\_OR\\_CIPHER\\_MISMATCH\". Which of course Chrome says its an unsupported protocol. \n\nNow I tried to play around with the settings on the server but it either doesn't work or breaks my installation and have to reinstall it. I've done many searches on Google and can't seem to find a solution. I know NetWare SSL protocols are very old so I'm sure that has something to do with it. \n\nFor a server that old and is just on my local network, I don't think SSL and secured websites are necessary. My question is, how do I go about disabling SSL on all web services on NetWare? Again, I tried playing with the Apache settings, Tomcat settings and all that good jazz but to no avail. Any suggestions on how to even use this server with a modern day web browser? This is a project that's just for fun so this thing isn't going into serious production anywhere. Mostly using it as a retro computing file sharing server later down the road. \n\n  \nThanks all!"

Over a span of one year we plan to integrate around 1200 cameras from transmitting data to 70+ dedicated NVRs to one centralized storage array solution (Scale out NAS or SAN). Our campus covers over 12 Kilometers in distance.\n\nThe main challenges faced in our existing case are:\n\n* Recurring purchase, installation, and maintenance of NVRs.\n* Scattered and locally placed NVRs pose security threats and maintenance difficulties.\n* Increasing physical space requirements to place NVRs and racks.\n* Low data retrieval rate, which is time-consuming.\n* Facing difficulties while sharing data with government agencies.\n* Time-consuming process for configuration changes.\n* Integration and compatibility issues with third-party devices and applications.\n\nRequirements -\n\n1. Bulk or single storage solution to eliminate the NVR setup.\n2. Fast data storage and quick retrieval.\n3. Minimal physical space needed.\n4. Easy scalability.\n5. High data security.\n6. Phase I: Urgent requirement of over 1PB of data retention for 250 camera footages with 6 months retention rate).\n7. Primary and secondary storages (live and backup).\n\nShort term focus -\n\n* Compatibility with VMS software that has a strong growth trend towards AI integration\n* Compatibility with UNV brand cameras, the average out of the 1200 cameras have a 2MP, 1080@25fps HD resolution recording function\n* To save budget our, hardware preference would be SAS based HDDs instead of a hybrid SSD/HDD approach\n* We would primarily want to procure a SAN based storage instead of a scale out NAS for a long term solution.\n\nLonger term focus:\n\n* Analytics - We want to have a stronger mechanism for finding the footage we need, our current VMS software does not provide any analytics features as the support plan is limited.\n* Faster Retrieval rate - Currently the data stored in the NVRs is very difficult to locate and recover in a quick manner when dealing with any government officials.\n* Cloud integration for other branch locations\n\n  \nAny recommendations for a mid to large-size surveillance deployments would be much appreaciated!"

I know errors, their button,s and options vary, but what is the best practice to go about resolving this. I thought maybe I could write something that would target the \"okay\" button and write a task that that upon seeing the event executes the script or looking into making the event invisible but a lot of my searching for at least some starting guidance is limited and I was hoping someone here may have executed some kind of solution for this exact thing and might be able to put me on the right path."

We have the problem that it sometimes happens that printers are renamed incorrectly / location data is stored incorrectly or that printer queues are sometimes accidentally deleted because the wrong printer has been selected. Errors can happen, but we should be able to detect errors before users report them.\n\n\nI am looking for a system in which I can audit the configuration of the printer queues on the server. What I have found so far only provides audit options for print jobs."

I'd like to see some other opinions but here's what I think: eggster has good enough mechanics and game sense to go pro, but his agent pool is terrible.  His mechanics kind of remind me of a slightly worse version of Jawgemo's (from the bit of Jawgemo I've seen).  I personally think he will never be able to go pro even if he wanted to just because of how bad his agent pool is, and the fact that I don't think his mechanics are good enough to be a good fragging duelist at the top level (what he currently does in ranked).  I'm really interested to see what everybody else thinks!"

Both games at the start when it pulls up the gun screen, it won't let me back out of it. I've clicked every button possible and even held the back button and it still stays up. Then I eventually die from being \"AFK.\" I've gotten a warning twice now for being AFK in the game, but there's nothing I can do. Is anyone else having this problem or am I doing something wrong. I'm on Xbox."

Half of my games mostly go by teaching my teammates where the sites are and where to peek, etc.(iron lobby). Does the aim really stays almost the same when you move up lobbies? And whenever I play a silver player I can't even peek coz I feel like I am getting tapped almost every single time. But my friends in bronze don't think that much aim difference is there and they have very good aim."

My mechanics are solid. I have to imagine that because of this, the hidden MMR is putting me against better players. But wtf, that system is ass.

I can't make callouts without being harassed or bullied and while I've just defaulted to turning my mic off typing in chat sucks. I know most people will say just mute them or ignore it but it's so disheartening that I can't play or make callouts without being harassed. \n\nIt's not every game but it's a good majority of them.

I have been playing valorant on pc for a while but started on ps5 just recently.\n\nI’m not sure if I have dumb thumbs or what but the precision aiming that is part of valorant is pretty tough on a controller for me. Any advice for aim settings or any other tips? Does the game have a type of aim assist?\n\nAlso it seems like crouching is much more important on console for spray control. Any truth to that?"

            "Original": "Hello Everyone,  \n[jmev#1337's Competitive Multiplayer Overview - Valorant Tracker](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/jmev%231337/overview)\n\nI am a casual gamer but very competitive. I've been watching videos, practicing, and trying to get better. I have been struggling to win ever since I reached the B3/S1 rank. My challenges seem to stem from game sense and the duelist role of creating space. Here are a few issues I've identified:\n\n1. When watching higher-elo players, they seem to have an easier time getting onto the site than I do. Although I don’t have any excuses, one issue I face is that most of my team’s agents aren’t ideal. I try to communicate when I'm going in, but I don’t get traded because our pacing is completely off. I also struggle with not getting a smoke or Sova dart when needed. I often don’t ask for these, so that might be my fault. My question is: How can I get onto the site to create space when the team composition isn't ideal?\n2. As a duelist, we often have more than one on the team. Is it wrong for me to lurk occasionally? I ask because lurking is the only time I’ve had major success, as opposed to trying to create space and dying without achieving much. However, I hope this will change as I progress.\n3. My aim is improving, but I find the Phantom might work better for me than the Vandal as a duelist. I am working on my Vandal skills but still struggle more than I should. When I play Jett and use the Outlaw/AWP, I perform much better, but I worry this is becoming a crutch that I'm relying on too heavily. Should I keep at it with the Vandal or use whatever is better for myself?\n4. This question concerns agent selection. I’ve been told that Renya is a good choice until Gold. However, I believe that if I invest time now in mastering agents that will benefit me in the long run, it might be more advantageous. I’ve mainly been playing Jett but have unlocked Raze. Do you think it’s smarter to continue with Jett/Raze or should I focus on Renya to improve my skills as a duelist?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgscj267s4id1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e354a87f19c24c4fac952196510be45ed8afdc\n\nThank you so much for any tips, tricks, advice or help."

So here are 2 clips from attack and defense in my most recent ranked match.\n\n  \nI am just curious if you all might think I'm getting burnt out or if I simply need improvement. The reason I think I may be burnt out is that I went from Gold 1 to Gold 3 in 2 days, and then the whole next week, I didn't win a single game and went back down to Gold 1. The clips I have here are from a losing game as well, and I feel like I didn't play terribly like the others. It was one of my first times playing KJ in the comp, so some things may be wonky (I'm usually a controller/initiator). Please tell me if I just need a break, or if you see anything to improve and how to practice said thing.\n\n[PS: My mic is muted in the vid.](https://reddit.com/link/1epztd1/video/pipbezj2l4id1/player)\n\nThanks :)"

Against minors that rises to **121%** more dps.\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, according to MossyMax's damage charts an energy legendary 120 scout does 520 dps to minors.  After the last few rounds of buffs most primaries are now sitting in the 500-600 dps range, so this is already quite good.  DMT does **1267** dps (taking the kinetic bonus into account).\n\n\nAgainst majors (champs, minibosses, bosses), DMT is respectable as well, doing trace rifle dps when ramped up and you can add another 20% from vorpal to that.\n\n\nTL;DR version:  DMT absolutely deletes red bars now.  It's like a 140 hand cannon that hits more than twice as hard and with another ~10m of range."

            "Original": "Basically I watched through Datto's video on his Raid Encounters Tier list and was wondering how the raids as a whole would rank based on how he ranked the encounters. So I gave each tier a score S=6, A=5, etc. and added all the encounters up and divided by the amount encounters the raid had to give an average score for the raid. Not a perfect system as there are a lot of ties and I ignored the \"Not Really an Encounter tier.\"\n\nHere is the list:\n\n1. Spire of Stars 4.33\n2. Scourge of the Past 4.25\n2. Vow of the Disciple 4.25\n3. Last Wish 4.16\n4. Kings Fall 4\n4. Wrath of the Machine 4\n4. Leviathan 4\n4. Salvation's Edge 4\n5. Vault of Glass 3.8\n6. Deep Stone Crypt 3.4\n7. Eater of Worlds 3.33\n7. Crown of Sorrow 3.33\n8. Crota's End 3.25\n9. Garden of Salvation 3\n10. Root of Nightmares 2.75\n\nHere is the link to Datto's Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klvCQzfVbf4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klvCQzfVbf4)"

This should absolutely make a return as a new way to make Orbs.\n\nHere were a few of the ways Explosive Wellmaker made wells, which could easily be turned into Orbs: Telesto bolts, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and most grenades.\n\nHere are a couple more ideas:\n\n**Entropic Orbmaker:** *Rapid ticking damage you do spawns an Orb of Power.* (poison, LeMonarque poison, scorch, unravel)\n\n**Strategic Orbmaker:** *Ability kills stemming from your class ability spawn an Orb of Power.* (Bombardiers, strand clone, Hazardous Propulsion, Vesper, arc soul, solar soul, void soul, weaver's call, frostpulse, Khepri's Horn, Phoenix Dive, Trapper's Ambush etc, etc, etc)"

            "Original": "I have seen a few posts regarding farming Solstice bounties, and I have a farm that I have not seen mentioned anywhere else. This farm does follow the same methods of the others to choose orb generation bounties. However, to maximize your leaves, instead of resetting the bounties if the orb bounty is not listed, you will choose the bounty to get kills with elemental damage as well.\n\nTo start, you will need to have the following:\n\n1. Prismatic subclass with super matching the element of your seasonal weapon.\n1. Seasonal weapon, either crafted or dropped is fine.\n1. Harmonic Siphon helmet mod.\n1. Logic Reductor artifact mod.\n1. Golgoroth Maze Checkpoint.\n\nOnce you have all of these, you will travel to the Golgoroth Maze checkpoint and travel forward, take the first right, then the next left, then the next right, and finally, another right. After making that last right, you will travel down the hallway until you see a couple thrall in between 2 sections of columns.\n\nThese thrall will respawn within a second or two after being killed, and they do not move from that small area they are confined in. This is what makes the farm great. Once here, you can choose your orb generation bounties, or the elemental damage bounty if the orb bounty is not listed. While the elemental damage bounty has less chance of dropping the weapons or armor, it is better than spending 5 leaves to reset and hope that the orb bounty appears.\n\nAfter you have the bounties, you only need to equip your seasonal weapon that has Radiolaria Transposer, and then kill the thrall. You might have to kill two waves of them to get the Radiolaria Transposer to pop, but once it does, you can sit back and let farm work its magic. With the artifact mod, the constantly respawning thrall will keep it going for longer and continuously, so you can stand there and wait for all your bounties to finish. Your seasonal weapon's element and your super for prismatic will need to match so that your harmonic siphon will generate orbs, but you will get about 2% of the bounty with each respawn. On top of this, if you use a crafted seasonal weapon, this is a great farm for weapon levels too as the Radiolaria Transposer kills count towards the weapon XP and total kill count.\n\nDoing this farm, your elemental damage bounties will complete in seconds, while the orb generation may take about 3 minutes to complete. Once done, you can grab more bounties without needing to speak to Eva and you can farm this repeatedly, as long as you have leaves available.\n\nTo make things easier, I have also added this video of the process using Corrasion and an arc super with prismatic:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wwyLRpNR2PQ"

Kills with other weapons slightly increases this weapons blast radius for a short duration (3s), kills with this weapon provide an extended duration (6s) with improved blast and velocity. \n\nThis will make it's auto reload for 3 target hits more viable, increase dmg chance so you can be a little less accurate for tagging and weapon swapping, doesnt make it to OP."

Trying to get precision kills in any of the ritual gamemodes is fairly easy with any other weapon and enough rounds played, but sniper rifles are one of the most antithetical weapons to the fast-paced environments you have to deal with. Having to hold still, scope in, and deal with flinch throwing off your aim is only suitable to specific maps in Crucible. Getting precision kills with *sidearms* is easier than sniper rifles. This node needs to be taken out entirely."

The ole homeowner is still going after them for the eviction and she is using that to get people to donate more money to her. It makes me sick and she needs to be held accountable. She recently has been arrested for domestic assault, child endangerment and many more things. I’ve reported the account and it’s still up. I’ve emailed the people that did an article on her and they basically said oh well we can’t co tell what she does. \nThis person is lying and making people believe she has her kids and is now being evicted…. I have proof of all these claims by the way if I need to show them to the proper people or organization. I can’t sit and watch her take advantage of innocent people anymore."

It wasn’t my first or second time seeing the add so I decided to click on it. To my surprise the website looked pretty well put together and the impulsive millennial in me shot out like lightning. Now, before you say it, yes that was extremely stupid, but I’m all about a good deal and I’ve bought so many items from websites like these and things have actually gone well. At first, I had like $200 USD worth of items in my cart, but considering this was my first time using the website I decided that I’m going to give it a test run first and brought it all down to $40 USD (I was actually okay with losing that amount) However, I got curious and decided to Google and do some research and nobody really could confirm or deny the websites credibility. I immediately got nervous. I tried to email the storefront to get a refund but no one replied. A few days go by and I check the tracking that was given and it’s in transit. I will keep everyone updated as I REALLY hope I didn’t do something stupid. In the meantime, I’m getting a new debit card and hope my information isn’t all on the dark web or something already.

My response was: “I’d prefer getting more details here before moving to any phone discussions” and she replied “Yes, I would prefer a phone call.” Which makes no sense in regards to what I said.\n\nWhat do you all think?

As a kid, my dad was often times unemployed and my Mom struggled just to make ends meet cleaning houses. He would be out doing meth and cheating on my Mom, he also stole from us to pay for his addiction. Even when he had a great truck driving job, he didn't send us much money for food so I know what it is like to have to go to bed hungry and the guilt my Mom felt not being able to feed us during hard times. She did her best BTW and was able to leave him and took us with her. Anyways, I asked this woman how much she needed and she said in broken English, \"Go to self check out.\" and was being a little pushy about it. That's when my gut told me to stop and get away from her. I told her polity \"I'd very sorry but I can't afford to help.\" Had to repeat this 3 times. When I left Target, I felt so low but then it hit me, \"Why would she be there with all that baby stuff knowing that she didn't have the money to pay for it?\" Was this really a scam or do you guys think that she really needed help?"

Much of it is “sensitive,” making it “valuable for malicious actors,” per Cybernews, which first discovered the breach on an unsecured website.\n“The dataset is extremely dangerous as threat actors could leverage the aggregated data for a wide range of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts,” the researchers, comprised of cybersecurity expert Bob Dyachenko and the team at Cybernews, explained.\n\n\n\n3\n\nThe latest data breach is considered the largest of all time. IncrediVFX – stock.adobe.com\n\nCybernews’ head of security research Mantas Sasnauskas told the Daily Mail that “probably the majority of the population have been affected.”\nThe one glimmer of hope, though, is that the 12 terabytes of data, which appears to be a meticulous compilation of many breaches (COMB), does not contain anything “newly stolen.”\nCybernews said it “discovered billions upon billions of exposed records on an open instance,” which means it was open for anyone to see.\n\n\n3\n\nExperts are urging users to stay vigilant about phishing scams and to change their passwords. terovesalainen – stock.adobe.com\nWhile the owner is likely to never be identified, the team hypothesized that they could be a data broker, malicious cybercriminal or someone with access to large amounts of data.\n \n\n\n\t\t\tsee also\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\tMake your passwords secure with this one quick hack — and bring positivity to your life, too\t\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest amount of data exposed is from the Chinese instant messaging platform Tencent, with 1.4 billion records compromised.\nWeibo trailed behind with 504 million records leaked, MySpace with 360 million, Twitter with 281 million, music streaming platform Deezer with 258 million and LinkedIn with 251 million.\nOther major sites include Adobe, Telegram and Dropbox, as well as lesser-known sites like Doordash, Canva and Snapchat and various government organizations around the world, including those in the US.\nCybernews has compiled a searchable list online where users can look up potentially compromised sites.\nUsers can also look up email addresses and phone numbers using Cybernews’ personal data leak checker.\nThe scale of the leak’s impact is likely to be “unprecedented,” according to Cybernews, and the sheer volume of data compromised makes past breaches look minuscule in comparison.\nIn November, the outlet reported a COMB that revealed 3.2 billion records, which was considered the “largest breach of all time” when discovered.\n\n\n3\n\n“We should never underestimate what cybercriminals can achieve with such limited information,” Eset’s global cybersecurity advisory Jake Moore told Computer Weekly. Gorodenkoff – stock.adobe.com\n“If users use the same passwords for their Netflix account as they do for their Gmail account, attackers can use this to pivot towards other, more sensitive accounts,” they explained. \n“Apart from that, users whose data has been included in supermassive MOAB may become victims of spear-phishing attacks or receive high levels of spam emails.”\nExperts have long advised against re-using the same, easily guessed passwords for multiple accounts, while recommending the use of a password manager to create and store strong logins.\n“We should never underestimate what cybercriminals can achieve with such limited information,” Eset’s global cybersecurity advisory Jake Moore told Computer Weekly.\n\nHe urged people to change their passwords promptly, stay vigilant against phishing emails and turn on two-factor authentication for all accounts, regardless of whether they were affected by the latest breach.\n“Many systems share platforms and are aggressively attempted with the latest attacks,” he continued. “Lots of networks rely heavily on updates, but when a vulnerability is located, it is a race against time to patch the issue before the data is compromised.”\n \n\n\n\nFiled under\n\n\ncybersecurity\n\n\ndata\n\n\ndata breach\n\n\nleaks\n\n\npasswords\n\n\n1/23/24 \n\n\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhy Gen Zers are through working 9 to 5: 'Not something I ...\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Concerts\n\n\n\nVividseats: Official Ticketing Partner of New York Post\n\n\n\t\t\tGet seats.

A breach in healthcare is a serious situation where someone's private health information is accessed or shared without permission. This can happen in different ways, like through computer hacking, lost or stolen devices, or mishandling patient records. It's important to know what a healthcare breach is to keep patient information safe and follow rules like HIPAA. This guide explains what happens during a breach, common causes, and how to prevent them to help healthcare workers protect sensitive patient information.In today's digital age, this question is vital for everyone involved in healthcare. As medical records and patient data go digital, understanding these breaches is crucial. But what exactly counts as a breach? How are healthcare systems breached in the first place? And what are indicators that a breach has occurred?Recognizing the early signs of such breaches can help prevent them, protecting both patients and providers. But first, it’s important to understand what kinds of incidents count as a healthcare breach.Why? Because these incidents affect not just the privacy of patients but also the trust they place in healthcare systems. What are the different types of data breaches in healthcare?In healthcare, databreaches can occur in various forms, including: Hacking or IT Incidents: Unauthorized access to health care systems through cyber attacks, such as ransomware or phishing. Lost or Stolen Devices: Misplaced or stolen laptops, smartphones, or USB drives containing sensitive patient information. Insider Threats: Employees or contractors accessing or disclosing patient data without authorization, either maliciously or accidentally. Human Error: Mistakes like sending patient information to the wrong recipient or improperly disposing of medical records.  Physical Theft: Stealing physical documents or devices from healthcare facilities.What Constitutes a Data Breach in Healthcare?Not every data incident counts as a data breach. That’s what makes the answer deceptively tricky.Think of it this way: We all know what a forest fire is. But at what point does a “normal” fire turn into a forest fire? What’s the tipping point between a tree – or a few trees – being on fire and then a blaze being classified as a forest fire?Similarly, when we answer “what is a data breach in healthcare,” we’re looking for that singular tipping point.A data breach in healthcare is a specific kind of incident that compromises patient privacy. What sets this apart from other incidents is that an unauthorized person has access to confidential patient information. In other words, something is only considered a “data breach” if an unauthorized party accesses patient data. On the other hand, if data is mishandled but not exposed to an unauthorized person, then it is not considered a data breach.Examples of a data breach in healthcare include, but are not limited to:A hacker gaining entry into a provider's electronic health record system.An employee looking at a patient's records without any work-related reason.Sharing patient information without consent or necessity. Sending a patient's health records to the wrong person or organization.Leaving printed patient information in a public area.It’s important to note that a security breach in healthcare is different from a “data incident.”“Data incident” is a broader term that includes any security event that could potentially compromise patient data. However, if there's no evidence that the data was actually accessed or used improperly, it's considered an incident, not a breach. Examples of a data incident include, but are not limited to:A laptop containing health records is stolen. However, the laptop is recovered before any logs or data can be accessed. An employee accidentally emails PHI to themselves, but reports the incident before any harm is done.The key to recognizing privacy breaches in healthcare is to determine whether unauthorized parties have accessed patient information.It's also important to note how healthcare data breaches are not just another IT problem. They are concerning because of the nature of the sensitive health information involved. Unlike a system outage, which affects accessibility, or a software bug, which might affect functionality, a data breach has direct implications for patient privacy and trust.So, what are data breaches in healthcare? It’s when an unauthorized person accesses protected health information (PHI). Investing in robust healthcare data management is key to preventing such breaches.Why Is Healthcare A Prime Target for Hackers and Cyber Attacks?If we look into why the healthcare sector is targeted in data breaches, it's because of the valuable patient information they have. This information can include everything from names and addresses to more sensitive details like health history.Our healthcare data breach case study reveals that stolen medical files are more valuable than another other type of file. Specifically, according to healthcare security statistics, the price of a patient file on the black market is $250 per file. That’s a whopping 46 times more valuable than stolen credit cards, which are valued at $5.40.So, what is the main cause of healthcare data breaches? It's typically old computer systems and legacy programs that need to be updated. While it’s impossible to be entirely breach-proof, investing in a modern, no-code internal app can exponentially reduce your risk. Healthcare data is a jackpot for hackers, brimming with invaluable patient information. A HIPAA-compliant, no-code tool like Blaze can be your digital shield, effortlessly fortifying your data defenses.What Are Common Indicators of a Breach in Healthcare? Kee­ping patient data safe is key. Be­ on the lookout for certain signs that could hint at a data leak. He­re's what to watch for:Too many failed login tries: It might me­an someone is attempting to access data they shouldn't see.Data is being sent to parties without reason: It could be he­alth details being transferre­d wrongfully.Unusual edits are being made in patient records:It may mean someone's me­ssing with confidential health details.System/software alerts. It's typically the­ first hint of a potential data leak.Sudden, odd tweaks in system setup: It could suggest an outside­r is trying to sneak in and cover their tracks.If you find these issues, you may be the victim of a breach in healthcare. If so, you have­ to alert those affecte­d. A report on the leak ne­eds to be drawn up, outlining what happene­d. If the data leak exte­nds to 500 or more people, it ne­eds an inside response­, and officials and the public have to be notifie­d.Watching for these­ signs can catch healthcare data leaks e­arly. It lets healthcare folk move­ fast to lock down patient records and lesse­n harm to those affected. Spotting the­ symptoms in time is vital to keeping he­althcare data secure.Actionable Steps to Monitor and Prevent Data BreachesHealthcare­ organizations must fortify their data security against growing cyber thre­ats. Here are some­ practical steps they should consider:Update­ and Patch Regularly: Get ahead of hacke­rs. Ensure you are up-to-date with se­curity patches.Security Training: Give staff the­ skills needed to ide­ntify and handle security threats with re­gular training.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA gives extra se­curity, challenging unauthorized access. The two most popular types are 2FA and SSO. Audits: Conduct re­gular audits and test for vulnerabilities.Compliant Tools: Use­ AI tools, like Blaze, a HIPAA compliant app builder, to build your systems securely.The­se steps help he­althcare providers comply with the HIPAA bre­ach notification rule. This rule states that affe­cted individuals, the Departme­nt of Health and Human Services (HHS), and in ce­rtain situations, the media, must be notifie­d of a breach if it affects many people­.Handling health care data effe­ctively is essential for me­eting legal obligations and for maintaining patient trust and the­ safety of health insurance de­tails. Quick notification to affected parties is vital whe­n a breach happens. In some instance­s, sending a large, or class mail, might be re­quired.It's not just rules-following. It's about a future­ where medical file­s are safer, easie­r to manage. That's comforting for doctors and patients. Want bette­r data protection? Blaze gives a no-cost consult.
